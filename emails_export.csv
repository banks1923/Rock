2. Wall located in the stairwell to the garage has continued to peel and it requires attention. 




3. Potential structural issue with a soft spot at the top of the staircase of the stairwell that leads to the garage. I’ll add a picture for reference. Dean confirmed he felt the soft spot when I pointed it out on January 7, 2025.

I would like clarification on whether you recorded inside the unit and if so, why. As you were leaving, you appeared to be holding your phone in a recording position while walking up the stairs from the garage and through the unit until you exited. My minor children were home at the time, and I take this matter seriously. Recording inside a private residence without consent is a violation of state law. If I do not receive a response with clarification, I will have to report this to law enforcement or the appropriate authorities.&nbsp; Jennifer Burbank On Mar 2, 2025, at 9:00 AM, Stoneman &lt;518stoneman@gmail.com&gt; wrote: ﻿ M/M Burbank,&nbsp; We are not able to accommodate the schedule requested&nbsp; in your email from March 1, 2025-&nbsp; &nbsp; "" March 2, 2025, between 10:00 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. &nbsp;"" for placement of tarps and sandbags in the patio area of 518 Stoneman .&nbsp; Gail Houser On Sat, Mar 1, 2025 at 11:11 PM Jen Barreda &lt; jenbarreda@yahoo.com &gt; wrote: Dean, If you believe that covering the planters and cracked tiles with sandbags is necessary to prevent water intrusion, you are welcome to do so on March 2, 2025, between 10:00 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. This does seem to indicate that you believe the patio is contributing to the issue, which we have raised multiple times.

Good Morning,

I am following up again on when the pipes in the garage will be repaired and if there are any plans to fix or address the issue in the patio which has caused water intrusion and has not been addressed. I also sent a follow up email on October 28, 2024, with no response to my questions.

I am also following up on my previous request for copies of the plumbers reports, for both dates, September 28, 2024 and October 16, 2024. Brian mentioned briefly in a call on October 29, 2024 that he has reviewed the reports from the plumbers and I would like to have a copy for my records.

Hello Grace,

Thank you for the message. I received a missed call from the lotus property services general number, I assumed it was Sally trying to reach me. However, Sally confirmed she was not the one who called me and no voicemail was left. Therefore, I had no way to verify who called and was trying to reach me.

Please go ahead and share my email and James’ email with Brian. I would prefer for all communication to be in writing either via email or text message.

Thank you and have a good evening.

Subject: Re: Maintenance Request Follow-Up



Good Afternoon Sally,



I want to address the ongoing concerns that seem to contradict your recent statements in your previous email. I continue to experience significant issues with water intrusion from the patio, which has led to leaks into the garage and is causing moisture damage to the baseboards and the flooring by the entryway and restroom. This continuous water intrusion is concerning, as it could pose safety and health risks for me and my family.



The toilet in the master bedroom has been leaking intermittently when flushed, leaving water on the floor. The owner previously mentioned on May 30 that he would replace the old seal and bolts, but that hasn’t happened yet. During the first plumber’s visit on September 28, an active leak was identified in the garage coming from one of the pipes, and he noted poorly done plumbing from previous work, stating that the certain pipes should be replaced. The second plumber, who came on October 16 with you, mentioned that a pipe was cracked and needed replacement. This not only contradicts your statement that no leaks were found, but it also fails to acknowledge that the pipes in the garage currently require maintenance.



In addition to these concerns, I noticed that your previous email did not mention a timeline for addressing the root cause of the water intrusion. As the patio seems to be the main source of water entering the unit, it’s essential that this issue is fixed to prevent ongoing damage. Can you provide an update on when the patio will be addressed, and if there is a plan in place to resolve the water intrusion at its source? Simply repairing baseboards or cosmetic damages without fixing the underlying problem seems ineffective, as the same issues will likely continue.



The baseboard that you stated was repaired appears to have only been filled with an adhesive or filler, rather than removed and replaced with a new baseboard. This is alarming given the obvious water damage to the baseboard, and since it wasn’t replaced, it remains damaged. Filling it without replacement does not seem to address the underlying issue of water exposure, and the baseboard is still in poor condition. The other baseboard in which you claim ""we did not see anything wrong"" shows visible separation from the wall, which is a sign of water damage, which I have stated numerous times to you and the landlords. The baseboards in the restroom by the entry way are also visibly damaged and were left untouched.



Lastly, the plumber’s suggestion of small cracks in the foundation causing water seepage is a serious matter that could lead to further significant damage if not properly addressed. Can you provide a timeline or plan for when this issue will be resolved to prevent further damage and water intrusion?



I would like to understand why these necessary repairs and maintenance seem to be overlooked. Could you clarify whether the delays in repairs and dismissal of repairs are due to decisions made by the landlords or if this is a matter of the property management company in which you represent, not recognizing the urgency of these issues?



As I mentioned in my previous email, I would like to request a copy of any reports or notes from both plumbers who inspected the unit on September 28 and October 16.

Hello Jennifer,





I have emailed you the annual inspection report requested by you,  See below for response.  Regarding the baseboard, the one that was repaired is the one to the right side of your living room where the little table is located, it was detaching from the wall.  We did not see anything wrong with the baseboard to the left between the entry door and the restroom. The plumber and I inspected the patio on 10/16/2024 and turned on the water hose for 10 to 15 minutes on all sides including the area where the plants are located.  We also waited for a while to see if any water leaked inside your entry way and in the garage area.  No signs of water intrusion were found.  As for the toilet upstairs in the master bedroom, we also inspected and per the plumber there were no leak.  We did let James know about the toilet upstairs and found no leaks and James said he just wanted to make sure.  Per the property Owners, he as well inspected your toilet, tightened the bolts, and found no leaks at that time.  Again, if you feel the toilet is leaking, please notify me immediately and I will return to inspect during the leak.



For the pipes in garage area, no leaks were found either. The plumber I was with on 10/16 did suggest that there may be small cracks in the foundation that may result in some water seeping through. The area was inspected by the plumber, and all was found to be dry on the day we inspected it.

Good Morning Sally,



I am following up on my email from Thursday, October 17th.



Please see email below.

Good Afternoon Sally,









I am following up on the maintenance that was scheduled yesterday (October 16, 2024).



It appears that two areas in the stair well leading down to the garage were patched up where there was visible paint peeling. The weather stripping at the front door has been replaced or fixed and now the door easily opens and closes. I also noted the peeling on the ceiling in the living room was also patched up.





However, the baseboards that you have mentioned many times, have not been touched. The patio was again, visibly inspected, by another plumber with no repairs made or resolution. The toilet in the master bedroom has been reported as leaking since May 30, 2024. It was initially reported to Brad and Vicki Martinez. Brad inspected the toilet himself and stated the he noticed a small drip while flushing and tightened the bolt. He stated he would order a new seal and bolts as the ones installed were old. I have now reported this same issue to you through the online portal, and to my surprise, it has been dismissed and not been repaired. I am asking again, to replace the toilet or to fix the toilet in the master bedroom. Having to deal with toilet water on the floor, damaging my bath rug and potentially the floor is unacceptable, especially since it has been four months and a half since we initially reported this issue, and nearly a month (27 days) since we have brought it to your attention.





The water intrusion coming into the unit in the living room from under the flooring is concerning and it is highly important and urgent. I am requesting an immediate and specific timeline of when this issue is going to be addressed and repaired. I am also requesting an immediate and specific timeline of when the leaks and pipes/plumbing in the garage will be addressed and repaired. This has become a burden to us as tenants and it is unacceptable. As tenants we have rights and we will exercise our tenant rights if these issues are not addressed, repaired and all completed within a timely manner.



I will go ahead and make more maintenance requests for each issue that has failed to be repaired or has been negligently dismissed. My requests should not be ""canceled"" through the online portal or considered ""complete"" if they have not been addressed and repaired.



You have stated that all repairs need to be discussed with the landlords, Brad and Vicki Martinez, before moving forward. Are the delays and lack of repairs due to Brad and Vicki Martinez delaying repairs and refusing to make other repairs in the unit? Please advise on why the repairs are being delayed and or are being dismissed.









I am requesting the full report from the initial walk through inspection when the take over occurred, a full report of when the plumber came to the unit on September 28, 2024 (the plumber stated he would be writing a report to his supervisor) and any reports or notes that include a timeline of these issues being addressed and repaired, primarily the outdoor patio and the plumbing in the garage.







Sincerely,



Jennifer Burbank

As previously mentioned in my email, the results of this test that was conducted by a professional, contracted by Lotus Property Services, Inc. was not conducted accurately. The day of the test, the entire unit had active HEPA air filters running. This does not provide accurate results, and as previously mentioned, this was an oversight by the professional. It is not fair to state these results suffice when the the test itself was not conducted accurately.
Ownership/management is responsible and legally obligated to maintain a habitable living space for the tenants. The mold in question is not any visible mold, but mold growing UNDER baseboards and floorboards which were damaged back in February of 2024, prior to Lotus Property Services, Inc. managing the unit and again on October 9, 2024, as reported through the online with photos for documentation. 
Management did not arrive to the unit until 7 days later, on October 16, 2024. By this date, Sally and the plumber that entered the unit, did not see any water as reported. The water had dried up within the week that it took for anyone to visit the unit to inspect. But again, I reported it as asked through the online portal and did provide photos.

Jen,
 
  
 
A mold air test was conducted on 10/2/24 and the report was emailed to you on 10/15/2024. TheLos Angeles County Public Health conducted an inspection on 10/24/2024 also cited that there were “No active water leaks in the garage and living room…No visible mold observed in the unit.” Ownership/management is not obligated to conduct any further testing.
 
  
 
We rely on the expertise of licensed professionals in the assisting concerns raised by all our tenants.
 
  
 
Should you notice any new water related issues, it is your obligation, as previously mentioned by Sally, to notify us immediately so that we can observe and document them.
 
 
 
Thank you!

Good Afternoon,
 
  
 
  
 
I am following up on this email regarding the results of the Mold Air Test. 
 
  
 
To add to my email from October 24, 2024, I believe the results of this test may be inaccurate due to the technicians oversight in the air purifiers running 24/7 in several rooms of the unit. Air purifiers can significantly reduce the amount of airborne mold spores and cause false negatives. The report from the technician did not state that air purifiers were present and on during the time the air test was conducted. Due to this oversight and water intrusion occurring after the air test was conducted, I am requesting another air test or a more comprehensive mold test. 
 
  
 
Again, this is a highly urgent and important concern that could significantly impact the health and safety of me and my family, primarily my young children, both under the age of 5.

Given the ongoing concerns related to water intrusion, moisture and potential mold growth, we believe that further testing is warranted to ensure the safety and habitability of the unit.

Hello Jen,





Please see attached results for the Mold Air Test completed on 10/02/2024 requested by you,  the results did not detect elevated level of moisture.  At this time, we will close out your mold testing request as this report will suffice.  As for the plumber, he will call me tomorrow with an update.

Good afternoon sally,



I wanted to follow up with the results of the mold air test that took place last week on 10/2/24.



I also wanted to follow up on any report or status update from when the plumber came to inspect the unit on 9/28/24.





Thank you.

Unfortunately, that day does not work for us.



Can this be scheduled on a Wednesday or Thursday?



Again, I want to reiterate what I mentioned on the phone yesterday, regardless of the results, we are not accepting the responsibility to pay for any mold testing to the unit since the water damage was not caused by us.

	Grace Cheng <grace@lotuspropertyservices.net>","Re: 518 N. Stoneman Ave., Alhambra"," Good Afternoon,

I am following up on this email regarding the results of the Mold Air Test. 
To add to my email from October 24, 2024, I believe the results of this test may be inaccurate due to the technicians oversight in the air purifiers running 24/7 in several rooms of the unit. Air purifiers can significantly reduce the amount of airborne mold spores and cause false negatives. The report from the technician did not state that air purifiers were present and on during the time the air test was conducted. Due to this oversight and water intrusion occurring after the air test was conducted, I am requesting another air test or a more comprehensive mold test. 
Again, this is a highly urgent and important concern that could significantly impact the health and safety of me and my family, primarily my young children, both under the age of 5.

  Good Afternoon Sally,

To clarify, we never received an email on October 9, 2024 as you claim, regarding the results of the Mold Air Test.
 I am writing to follow up on our request for a more comprehensive mold test, particularly in light of the recent water intrusion reported through the tenant portal on October 9, 2024, which occurred after the initial mold testing. Given the ongoing concerns related to water intrusion, moisture and potential mold growth, we believe that further testing is warranted to ensure the safety and habitability of the unit.
Please let us know if you have spoken to the landlords regarding their response to a more comprehensive mold test as this is an urgent concern for me and my family.

Hello Jen,


Please see attached results for the Mold Air Test completed on 10/02/2024 requested by you,  the results did not detect elevated level of moisture.  At this time, we will close out your mold testing request as this report will suffice.  As for the plumber, I had another plumber that has been trying to contact you regarding the parking area.  Please let me know what day works for you so he can go and inspect the area.



Thanks,

Good afternoon sally,

I wanted to follow up with the results of the mold air test that took place last week on 10/2/24.

I also wanted to follow up on any report or status update from when the plumber came to inspect the unit on 9/28/24.


Thank you.

I’m checking in to see if there is any update?

As you may have known, it rained over the weekend and our garage was leaking again and smelling absolutely foul, the way it smells when there is too much moisture sitting around, or mold. Which raises concerns again about mold in the unit, if it is not properly weather proofed.

We’ve mentioned it many times to multiple people throughout our tenancy. We have waited and are still waiting for necessary changes to be made to finally address and fix this year long issue. 

We also noticed some water again in our front entry area. An area that was affected and damaged last year in February due to rain. Again, raises significant concerns regarding mold if water enters the unit and sits there. 

Sincerely,
Jennifer Burbank

You stated you would provide an update after Thursday’s repairs and we have not received any updates. Therefore I am requesting for an update. 

I am still waiting to hear any update on the pipe in the garage that has been leaking since September 20, 2024 and was reported multiple times. Additionally we are awaiting any updates on the patio and if you plan to address and fix the patio to prevent more water intrusion.

I am also requesting an update on any reports or findings from ServPro regarding the water moisture in the unit. 

I am also awaiting repairs on the floor that is bouncy/has a soft spot and the wall in the stairwell near the garage that has been peeling over time. 

Please respond with a timeline or schedule for all these repairs.

	Grace Cheng <grace@lotuspropertyservices.net>",Re: Maintenance Request Follow-Up," Grace,
My email was following up on a very obvious tear/crack in a pipe in the garage (above the first parking spot, closest to the door to enter/exit garage). This pipe in question has not shown any leaks. However, there have been leaks in the garage. Sally and others have inspected the unit and see the clear water stains on the ceiling of the garage and the floor that came from a different pipe. It is not my responsibility or obligation as a tenant to figure that why a pipe is leaking, it is my duty to report to management, which I have done numerous times with no actions from management and ownership.
Management sent a plumber to the unit on 9/28/24 who witnessed a slow leak in the garage from a pipe that sits above the third parking spot, under the patio. The plumber inspected the patio and the garage looking for the source of the issue. This plumber stated he would let management know of the leak and the need to address it. He also pointed out a separate pipe (sitting above the second parking spot and walkway) that he saw was incorrectly put together and stated it should be addressed immediately. This licensed professional, contracted by management, stated these issues, yet no repairs have been made. 
I have also reported it on the online portal, again with photos for documentation. My request is still sitting in the portal with no urgency from management and ownership. I have fulfilled my obligations by reporting all issues and I am now awaiting for management and ownership to fulfill their obligations as well.     On Wednesday, November 6, 2024 at 04:29:14 PM PST, Grace Cheng <grace@lotuspropertyservices.net> wrote:

An email was sent by Sally to you on 10/31/2024 with a copy of the report from the Los Angeles County Public Health that was conducted on 10/24/2024 citing that there were “No active water leaks in the garage and living room, no uneven/cracked floor observed in the unit. No visible mold observed in the unit.” I am attaching it here again if you need it. Ownership/management has no obligation to provide any further reports but the plumber that was sent out also did not find any leaks.
 
  
 
No water intrusion or plumbing leaks have been witnessed by Ownership/management since the time of your first report. We rely on the expertise of licensed professionals in the assisting concerns raised by all our tenants.
 
  
 
It is your obligation, as previously mentioned by Sally, to notify us immediately of any water related issues so that we can observe and document them.
 
  
 
Thank you!

Good Morning,
 
  
 
I am following up again on when the pipes in the garage will be repaired and if there are any plans to fix or address the issue in the patio which has caused water intrusion and has not been addressed. I also sent a follow up email on October 28, 2024, with no response to my questions. 
 
  
 
I am also following up on my previous request for copies of the plumbers reports, for both dates, September 28, 2024 and October 16, 2024. Brian mentioned briefly in a call on October 29, 2024 that he has reviewed the reports from the plumbers and I would like to have a copy for my records.

However, Sally confirmed she was not the one who called me and no voicemail was left. Therefore, I had no way to verify who called and was trying to reach me.

Subject: Re: Maintenance Request Follow-Up
 
 
 
Good Afternoon Sally,
 
 
 
I want to address the ongoing concerns that seem to contradict your recent statements in your previous email. I continue to experience significant issues with water intrusion from the patio, which has led to leaks into the garage and is causing moisture damage to the baseboards and the flooring by the entryway and restroom. This continuous water intrusion is concerning, as it could pose safety and health risks for me and my family.
 
 
 
The toilet in the master bedroom has been leaking intermittently when flushed, leaving water on the floor. The owner previously mentioned on May 30 that he would replace the old seal and bolts, but that hasn’t happened yet. During the first plumber’s visit on September 28, an active leak was identified in the garage coming from one of the pipes, and he noted poorly done plumbing from previous work, stating that the certain pipes should be replaced. The second plumber, who came on October 16 with you, mentioned that a pipe was cracked and needed replacement. This not only contradicts your statement that no leaks were found, but it also fails to acknowledge that the pipes in the garage currently require maintenance.
 
 
 
In addition to these concerns, I noticed that your previous email did not mention a timeline for addressing the root cause of the water intrusion. As the patio seems to be the main source of water entering the unit, it’s essential that this issue is fixed to prevent ongoing damage. Can you provide an update on when the patio will be addressed, and if there is a plan in place to resolve the water intrusion at its source? Simply repairing baseboards or cosmetic damages without fixing the underlying problem seems ineffective, as the same issues will likely continue.
 
 
 
The baseboard that you stated was repaired appears to have only been filled with an adhesive or filler, rather than removed and replaced with a new baseboard. This is alarming given the obvious water damage to the baseboard, and since it wasn’t replaced, it remains damaged. Filling it without replacement does not seem to address the underlying issue of water exposure, and the baseboard is still in poor condition. The other baseboard in which you claim ""we did not see anything wrong"" shows visible separation from the wall, which is a sign of water damage, which I have stated numerous times to you and the landlords. The baseboards in the restroom by the entry way are also visibly damaged and were left untouched. 
 
 
 
Lastly, the plumber’s suggestion of small cracks in the foundation causing water seepage is a serious matter that could lead to further significant damage if not properly addressed. Can you provide a timeline or plan for when this issue will be resolved to prevent further damage and water intrusion?
 
 
 
I would like to understand why these necessary repairs and maintenance seem to be overlooked. Could you clarify whether the delays in repairs and dismissal of repairs are due to decisions made by the landlords or if this is a matter of the property management company in which you represent, not recognizing the urgency of these issues?
 
 
 
As I mentioned in my previous email, I would like to request a copy of any reports or notes from both plumbers who inspected the unit on September 28 and October 16.

Hello Jennifer,
 
 
 
 
 
I have emailed you the annual inspection report requested by you,  See below for response.  Regarding the baseboard, the one that was repaired is the one to the right side of your living room where the little table is located, it was detaching from the wall.  We did not see anything wrong with the baseboard to the left between the entry door and the restroom. The plumber and I inspected the patio on 10/16/2024 and turned on the water hose for 10 to 15 minutes on all sides including the area where the plants are located.  We also waited for a while to see if any water leaked inside your entry way and in the garage area.  No signs of water intrusion were found.  As for the toilet upstairs in the master bedroom, we also inspected and per the plumber there were no leak.  We did let James know about the toilet upstairs and found no leaks and James said he just wanted to make sure.  Per the property Owners, he as well inspected your toilet, tightened the bolts, and found no leaks at that time.  Again, if you feel the toilet is leaking, please notify me immediately and I will return to inspect during the leak. 
 
 
 
For the pipes in garage area, no leaks were found either. The plumber I was with on 10/16 did suggest that there may be small cracks in the foundation that may result in some water seeping through. The area was inspected by the plumber, and all was found to be dry on the day we inspected it.

I am following up on my email from Thursday, October 17th. 
 
 
 
Please see email below.

Good Afternoon Sally,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I am following up on the maintenance that was scheduled yesterday (October 16, 2024). 
 
 
 
It appears that two areas in the stair well leading down to the garage were patched up where there was visible paint peeling. The weather stripping at the front door has been replaced or fixed and now the door easily opens and closes. I also noted the peeling on the ceiling in the living room was also patched up.
 
 
 
 
 
However, the baseboards that you have mentioned many times, have not been touched. The patio was again, visibly inspected, by another plumber with no repairs made or resolution. The toilet in the master bedroom has been reported as leaking since May 30, 2024. It was initially reported to Brad and Vicki Martinez. Brad inspected the toilet himself and stated the he noticed a small drip while flushing and tightened the bolt. He stated he would order a new seal and bolts as the ones installed were old. I have now reported this same issue to you through the online portal, and to my surprise, it has been dismissed and not been repaired. I am asking again, to replace the toilet or to fix the toilet in the master bedroom. Having to deal with toilet water on the floor, damaging my bath rug and potentially the floor is unacceptable, especially since it has been four months and a half since we initially reported this issue, and nearly a month (27 days) since we have brought it to your attention. 
 
 
 
 
 
The water intrusion coming into the unit in the living room from under the flooring is concerning and it is highly important and urgent. I am requesting an immediate and specific timeline of when this issue is going to be addressed and repaired. I am also requesting an immediate and specific timeline of when the leaks and pipes/plumbing in the garage will be addressed and repaired. This has become a burden to us as tenants and it is unacceptable. As tenants we have rights and we will exercise our tenant rights if these issues are not addressed, repaired and all completed within a timely manner. 
 
 
 
I will go ahead and make more maintenance requests for each issue that has failed to be repaired or has been negligently dismissed. My requests should not be ""canceled"" through the online portal or considered ""complete"" if they have not been addressed and repaired.
 
 
 
You have stated that all repairs need to be discussed with the landlords, Brad and Vicki Martinez, before moving forward. Are the delays and lack of repairs due to Brad and Vicki Martinez delaying repairs and refusing to make other repairs in the unit? Please advise on why the repairs are being delayed and or are being dismissed.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I am requesting the full report from the initial walk through inspection when the take over occurred, a full report of when the plumber came to the unit on September 28, 2024 (the plumber stated he would be writing a report to his supervisor) and any reports or notes that include a timeline of these issues being addressed and repaired, primarily the outdoor patio and the plumbing in the garage.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sincerely,

	<sally@lotuspropertyservices.net>",RE: Maintenance Request Follow-Up,"Jen,

An email was sent by Sally to you on 10/31/2024 with a copy of the report from the Los Angeles County Public Health that was conducted on 10/24/2024 citing that there were “No active water leaks in the garage and living room, no uneven/cracked floor observed in the unit. No visible mold observed in the unit.” I am attaching it here again if you need it. Ownership/management has no obligation to provide any further reports but the plumber that was sent out also did not find any leaks.

No water intrusion or plumbing leaks have been witnessed by Ownership/management since the time of your first report. We rely on the expertise of licensed professionals in the assisting concerns raised by all our tenants.

It is your obligation, as previously mentioned by Sally, to notify us immediately of any water related issues so that we can observe and document them.

Thank you!

Good Morning,

I am following up again on when the pipes in the garage will be repaired and if there are any plans to fix or address the issue in the patio which has caused water intrusion and has not been addressed. I also sent a follow up email on October 28, 2024, with no response to my questions.

I am also following up on my previous request for copies of the plumbers reports, for both dates, September 28, 2024 and October 16, 2024. Brian mentioned briefly in a call on October 29, 2024 that he has reviewed the reports from the plumbers and I would like to have a copy for my records.

Hello Grace,

Thank you for the message. I received a missed call from the lotus property services general number, I assumed it was Sally trying to reach me. However, Sally confirmed she was not the one who called me and no voicemail was left. Therefore, I had no way to verify who called and was trying to reach me.

Please go ahead and share my email and James’ email with Brian. I would prefer for all communication to be in writing either via email or text message.

Thank you and have a good evening.

Subject: Re: Maintenance Request Follow-Up



Good Afternoon Sally,



I want to address the ongoing concerns that seem to contradict your recent statements in your previous email. I continue to experience significant issues with water intrusion from the patio, which has led to leaks into the garage and is causing moisture damage to the baseboards and the flooring by the entryway and restroom. This continuous water intrusion is concerning, as it could pose safety and health risks for me and my family.



The toilet in the master bedroom has been leaking intermittently when flushed, leaving water on the floor. The owner previously mentioned on May 30 that he would replace the old seal and bolts, but that hasn’t happened yet. During the first plumber’s visit on September 28, an active leak was identified in the garage coming from one of the pipes, and he noted poorly done plumbing from previous work, stating that the certain pipes should be replaced. The second plumber, who came on October 16 with you, mentioned that a pipe was cracked and needed replacement. This not only contradicts your statement that no leaks were found, but it also fails to acknowledge that the pipes in the garage currently require maintenance.



In addition to these concerns, I noticed that your previous email did not mention a timeline for addressing the root cause of the water intrusion. As the patio seems to be the main source of water entering the unit, it’s essential that this issue is fixed to prevent ongoing damage. Can you provide an update on when the patio will be addressed, and if there is a plan in place to resolve the water intrusion at its source? Simply repairing baseboards or cosmetic damages without fixing the underlying problem seems ineffective, as the same issues will likely continue.



The baseboard that you stated was repaired appears to have only been filled with an adhesive or filler, rather than removed and replaced with a new baseboard. This is alarming given the obvious water damage to the baseboard, and since it wasn’t replaced, it remains damaged. Filling it without replacement does not seem to address the underlying issue of water exposure, and the baseboard is still in poor condition. The other baseboard in which you claim ""we did not see anything wrong"" shows visible separation from the wall, which is a sign of water damage, which I have stated numerous times to you and the landlords. The baseboards in the restroom by the entry way are also visibly damaged and were left untouched.



Lastly, the plumber’s suggestion of small cracks in the foundation causing water seepage is a serious matter that could lead to further significant damage if not properly addressed. Can you provide a timeline or plan for when this issue will be resolved to prevent further damage and water intrusion?



I would like to understand why these necessary repairs and maintenance seem to be overlooked. Could you clarify whether the delays in repairs and dismissal of repairs are due to decisions made by the landlords or if this is a matter of the property management company in which you represent, not recognizing the urgency of these issues?



As I mentioned in my previous email, I would like to request a copy of any reports or notes from both plumbers who inspected the unit on September 28 and October 16.

Hello Jennifer,





I have emailed you the annual inspection report requested by you,  See below for response.  Regarding the baseboard, the one that was repaired is the one to the right side of your living room where the little table is located, it was detaching from the wall.  We did not see anything wrong with the baseboard to the left between the entry door and the restroom. The plumber and I inspected the patio on 10/16/2024 and turned on the water hose for 10 to 15 minutes on all sides including the area where the plants are located.  We also waited for a while to see if any water leaked inside your entry way and in the garage area.  No signs of water intrusion were found.  As for the toilet upstairs in the master bedroom, we also inspected and per the plumber there were no leak.  We did let James know about the toilet upstairs and found no leaks and James said he just wanted to make sure.  Per the property Owners, he as well inspected your toilet, tightened the bolts, and found no leaks at that time.  Again, if you feel the toilet is leaking, please notify me immediately and I will return to inspect during the leak.



For the pipes in garage area, no leaks were found either. The plumber I was with on 10/16 did suggest that there may be small cracks in the foundation that may result in some water seeping through. The area was inspected by the plumber, and all was found to be dry on the day we inspected it.

Good Afternoon Sally,









I am following up on the maintenance that was scheduled yesterday (October 16, 2024).



It appears that two areas in the stair well leading down to the garage were patched up where there was visible paint peeling. The weather stripping at the front door has been replaced or fixed and now the door easily opens and closes. I also noted the peeling on the ceiling in the living room was also patched up.





However, the baseboards that you have mentioned many times, have not been touched. The patio was again, visibly inspected, by another plumber with no repairs made or resolution. The toilet in the master bedroom has been reported as leaking since May 30, 2024. It was initially reported to Brad and Vicki Martinez. Brad inspected the toilet himself and stated the he noticed a small drip while flushing and tightened the bolt. He stated he would order a new seal and bolts as the ones installed were old. I have now reported this same issue to you through the online portal, and to my surprise, it has been dismissed and not been repaired. I am asking again, to replace the toilet or to fix the toilet in the master bedroom. Having to deal with toilet water on the floor, damaging my bath rug and potentially the floor is unacceptable, especially since it has been four months and a half since we initially reported this issue, and nearly a month (27 days) since we have brought it to your attention.





The water intrusion coming into the unit in the living room from under the flooring is concerning and it is highly important and urgent. I am requesting an immediate and specific timeline of when this issue is going to be addressed and repaired. I am also requesting an immediate and specific timeline of when the leaks and pipes/plumbing in the garage will be addressed and repaired. This has become a burden to us as tenants and it is unacceptable. As tenants we have rights and we will exercise our tenant rights if these issues are not addressed, repaired and all completed within a timely manner.



I will go ahead and make more maintenance requests for each issue that has failed to be repaired or has been negligently dismissed. My requests should not be ""canceled"" through the online portal or considered ""complete"" if they have not been addressed and repaired.



You have stated that all repairs need to be discussed with the landlords, Brad and Vicki Martinez, before moving forward. Are the delays and lack of repairs due to Brad and Vicki Martinez delaying repairs and refusing to make other repairs in the unit? Please advise on why the repairs are being delayed and or are being dismissed.









I am requesting the full report from the initial walk through inspection when the take over occurred, a full report of when the plumber came to the unit on September 28, 2024 (the plumber stated he would be writing a report to his supervisor) and any reports or notes that include a timeline of these issues being addressed and repaired, primarily the outdoor patio and the plumbing in the garage.

 Hello Grace,
Thank you for the message. I received a missed call from the lotus property services general number, I assumed it was Sally trying to reach me. However, Sally confirmed she was not the one who called me and no voicemail was left. Therefore, I had no way to verify who called and was trying to reach me.
Please go ahead and share my email and James’ email with Brian. I would prefer for all communication to be in writing either via email or text message. 
Thank you and have a good evening.

Subject: Re: Maintenance Request Follow-Up
 
  
 
Good Afternoon Sally,
 
 
 
I want to address the ongoing concerns that seem to contradict your recent statements in your previous email. I continue to experience significant issues with water intrusion from the patio, which has led to leaks into the garage and is causing moisture damage to the baseboards and the flooring by the entryway and restroom. This continuous water intrusion is concerning, as it could pose safety and health risks for me and my family.
 
 
 
The toilet in the master bedroom has been leaking intermittently when flushed, leaving water on the floor. The owner previously mentioned on May 30 that he would replace the old seal and bolts, but that hasn’t happened yet. During the first plumber’s visit on September 28, an active leak was identified in the garage coming from one of the pipes, and he noted poorly done plumbing from previous work, stating that the certain pipes should be replaced. The second plumber, who came on October 16 with you, mentioned that a pipe was cracked and needed replacement. This not only contradicts your statement that no leaks were found, but it also fails to acknowledge that the pipes in the garage currently require maintenance.
 
 
 
In addition to these concerns, I noticed that your previous email did not mention a timeline for addressing the root cause of the water intrusion. As the patio seems to be the main source of water entering the unit, it’s essential that this issue is fixed to prevent ongoing damage. Can you provide an update on when the patio will be addressed, and if there is a plan in place to resolve the water intrusion at its source? Simply repairing baseboards or cosmetic damages without fixing the underlying problem seems ineffective, as the same issues will likely continue.
 
 
 
The baseboard that you stated was repaired appears to have only been filled with an adhesive or filler, rather than removed and replaced with a new baseboard. This is alarming given the obvious water damage to the baseboard, and since it wasn’t replaced, it remains damaged. Filling it without replacement does not seem to address the underlying issue of water exposure, and the baseboard is still in poor condition. The other baseboard in which you claim ""we did not see anything wrong"" shows visible separation from the wall, which is a sign of water damage, which I have stated numerous times to you and the landlords. The baseboards in the restroom by the entry way are also visibly damaged and were left untouched. 
 
 
 
Lastly, the plumber’s suggestion of small cracks in the foundation causing water seepage is a serious matter that could lead to further significant damage if not properly addressed. Can you provide a timeline or plan for when this issue will be resolved to prevent further damage and water intrusion?
 
 
 
I would like to understand why these necessary repairs and maintenance seem to be overlooked. Could you clarify whether the delays in repairs and dismissal of repairs are due to decisions made by the landlords or if this is a matter of the property management company in which you represent, not recognizing the urgency of these issues?
 
 
 
As I mentioned in my previous email, I would like to request a copy of any reports or notes from both plumbers who inspected the unit on September 28 and October 16.

Hello Jennifer,
 
 
 
 
 
I have emailed you the annual inspection report requested by you,  See below for response.  Regarding the baseboard, the one that was repaired is the one to the right side of your living room where the little table is located, it was detaching from the wall.  We did not see anything wrong with the baseboard to the left between the entry door and the restroom. The plumber and I inspected the patio on 10/16/2024 and turned on the water hose for 10 to 15 minutes on all sides including the area where the plants are located.  We also waited for a while to see if any water leaked inside your entry way and in the garage area.  No signs of water intrusion were found.  As for the toilet upstairs in the master bedroom, we also inspected and per the plumber there were no leak.  We did let James know about the toilet upstairs and found no leaks and James said he just wanted to make sure.  Per the property Owners, he as well inspected your toilet, tightened the bolts, and found no leaks at that time.  Again, if you feel the toilet is leaking, please notify me immediately and I will return to inspect during the leak. 
 
 
 
For the pipes in garage area, no leaks were found either. The plumber I was with on 10/16 did suggest that there may be small cracks in the foundation that may result in some water seeping through. The area was inspected by the plumber, and all was found to be dry on the day we inspected it.

Good Morning Sally,
 
 
 
I am following up on my email from Thursday, October 17th. 
 
 
 
Please see email below.

Good Afternoon Sally,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I am following up on the maintenance that was scheduled yesterday (October 16, 2024). 
 
 
 
It appears that two areas in the stair well leading down to the garage were patched up where there was visible paint peeling. The weather stripping at the front door has been replaced or fixed and now the door easily opens and closes. I also noted the peeling on the ceiling in the living room was also patched up.
 
 
 
 
 
However, the baseboards that you have mentioned many times, have not been touched. The patio was again, visibly inspected, by another plumber with no repairs made or resolution. The toilet in the master bedroom has been reported as leaking since May 30, 2024. It was initially reported to Brad and Vicki Martinez. Brad inspected the toilet himself and stated the he noticed a small drip while flushing and tightened the bolt. He stated he would order a new seal and bolts as the ones installed were old. I have now reported this same issue to you through the online portal, and to my surprise, it has been dismissed and not been repaired. I am asking again, to replace the toilet or to fix the toilet in the master bedroom. Having to deal with toilet water on the floor, damaging my bath rug and potentially the floor is unacceptable, especially since it has been four months and a half since we initially reported this issue, and nearly a month (27 days) since we have brought it to your attention. 
 
 
 
 
 
The water intrusion coming into the unit in the living room from under the flooring is concerning and it is highly important and urgent. I am requesting an immediate and specific timeline of when this issue is going to be addressed and repaired. I am also requesting an immediate and specific timeline of when the leaks and pipes/plumbing in the garage will be addressed and repaired. This has become a burden to us as tenants and it is unacceptable. As tenants we have rights and we will exercise our tenant rights if these issues are not addressed, repaired and all completed within a timely manner. 
 
 
 
I will go ahead and make more maintenance requests for each issue that has failed to be repaired or has been negligently dismissed. My requests should not be ""canceled"" through the online portal or considered ""complete"" if they have not been addressed and repaired.
 
 
 
You have stated that all repairs need to be discussed with the landlords, Brad and Vicki Martinez, before moving forward. Are the delays and lack of repairs due to Brad and Vicki Martinez delaying repairs and refusing to make other repairs in the unit? Please advise on why the repairs are being delayed and or are being dismissed.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I am requesting the full report from the initial walk through inspection when the take over occurred, a full report of when the plumber came to the unit on September 28, 2024 (the plumber stated he would be writing a report to his supervisor) and any reports or notes that include a timeline of these issues being addressed and repaired, primarily the outdoor patio and the plumbing in the garage.

Good Afternoon Sally,



I want to address the ongoing concerns that seem to contradict your recent statements in your previous email. I continue to experience significant issues with water intrusion from the patio, which has led to leaks into the garage and is causing moisture damage to the baseboards and the flooring by the entryway and restroom. This continuous water intrusion is concerning, as it could pose safety and health risks for me and my family.

As the patio seems to be the main source of water entering the unit, it’s essential that this issue is fixed to prevent ongoing damage. Can you provide an update on when the patio will be addressed, and if there is a plan in place to resolve the water intrusion at its source? Simply repairing baseboards or cosmetic damages without fixing the underlying problem seems ineffective, as the same issues will likely continue.


The baseboard that you stated was repaired appears to have only been filled with an adhesive or filler, rather than removed and replaced with a new baseboard. This is alarming given the obvious water damage to the baseboard, and since it wasn’t replaced, it remains damaged. Filling it without replacement does not seem to address the underlying issue of water exposure, and the baseboard is still in poor condition. The other baseboard in which you claim ""we did not see anything wrong"" shows visible separation from the wall, which is a sign of water damage, which I have stated numerous times to you and the landlords. The baseboards in the restroom by the entry way are also visibly damaged and were left untouched.



Lastly, the plumber’s suggestion of small cracks in the foundation causing water seepage is a serious matter that could lead to further significant damage if not properly addressed. Can you provide a timeline or plan for when this issue will be resolved to prevent further damage and water intrusion?



I would like to understand why these necessary repairs and maintenance seem to be overlooked. Could you clarify whether the delays in repairs and dismissal of repairs are due to decisions made by the landlords or if this is a matter of the property management company in which you represent, not recognizing the urgency of these issues?


As I mentioned in my previous email, I would like to request a copy of any reports or notes from both plumbers who inspected the unit on September 28 and October 16.

Hello Jennifer,





I have emailed you the annual inspection report requested by you,  See below for response.  Regarding the baseboard, the one that was repaired is the one to the right side of your living room where the little table is located, it was detaching from the wall.  We did not see anything wrong with the baseboard to the left between the entry door and the restroom. The plumber and I inspected the patio on 10/16/2024 and turned on the water hose for 10 to 15 minutes on all sides including the area where the plants are located.  We also waited for a while to see if any water leaked inside your entry way and in the garage area.  No signs of water intrusion were found.  As for the toilet upstairs in the master bedroom, we also inspected and per the plumber there were no leak.  We did let James know about the toilet upstairs and found no leaks and James said he just wanted to make sure.  Per the property Owners, he as well inspected your toilet, tightened the bolts, and found no leaks at that time.  Again, if you feel the toilet is leaking, please notify me immediately and I will return to inspect during the leak.



For the pipes in garage area, no leaks were found either. The plumber I was with on 10/16 did suggest that there may be small cracks in the foundation that may result in some water seeping through. The area was inspected by the plumber, and all was found to be dry on the day we inspected it.

Good Afternoon Sally,









I am following up on the maintenance that was scheduled yesterday (October 16, 2024).



It appears that two areas in the stair well leading down to the garage were patched up where there was visible paint peeling. The weather stripping at the front door has been replaced or fixed and now the door easily opens and closes. I also noted the peeling on the ceiling in the living room was also patched up.





However, the baseboards that you have mentioned many times, have not been touched. The patio was again, visibly inspected, by another plumber with no repairs made or resolution. The toilet in the master bedroom has been reported as leaking since May 30, 2024. It was initially reported to Brad and Vicki Martinez. Brad inspected the toilet himself and stated the he noticed a small drip while flushing and tightened the bolt. He stated he would order a new seal and bolts as the ones installed were old. I have now reported this same issue to you through the online portal, and to my surprise, it has been dismissed and not been repaired. I am asking again, to replace the toilet or to fix the toilet in the master bedroom. Having to deal with toilet water on the floor, damaging my bath rug and potentially the floor is unacceptable, especially since it has been four months and a half since we initially reported this issue, and nearly a month (27 days) since we have brought it to your attention.





The water intrusion coming into the unit in the living room from under the flooring is concerning and it is highly important and urgent. I am requesting an immediate and specific timeline of when this issue is going to be addressed and repaired. I am also requesting an immediate and specific timeline of when the leaks and pipes/plumbing in the garage will be addressed and repaired. This has become a burden to us as tenants and it is unacceptable. As tenants we have rights and we will exercise our tenant rights if these issues are not addressed, repaired and all completed within a timely manner.



I will go ahead and make more maintenance requests for each issue that has failed to be repaired or has been negligently dismissed. My requests should not be ""canceled"" through the online portal or considered ""complete"" if they have not been addressed and repaired.



You have stated that all repairs need to be discussed with the landlords, Brad and Vicki Martinez, before moving forward. Are the delays and lack of repairs due to Brad and Vicki Martinez delaying repairs and refusing to make other repairs in the unit? Please advise on why the repairs are being delayed and or are being dismissed.









I am requesting the full report from the initial walk through inspection when the take over occurred, a full report of when the plumber came to the unit on September 28, 2024 (the plumber stated he would be writing a report to his supervisor) and any reports or notes that include a timeline of these issues being addressed and repaired, primarily the outdoor patio and the plumbing in the garage.

Good Afternoon Sally,

 

I want to address the ongoing concerns that seem tocontradict your recent statements in your previous email. I continue toexperience significant issues with water intrusion from the patio, which hasled to leaks into the garage and is causing moisture damage to the baseboardsand the flooring by the entryway and restroom. This continuous water intrusionis concerning, as it could pose safety and health risks for me and my family.

 

The toilet in the master bedroom has been leaking intermittentlywhen flushed, leaving water on the floor. The owner previously mentioned on May30 that he would replace the old seal and bolts, but that hasn’t happened yet.During the first plumber’s visit on September 28, an active leak was identifiedin the garage coming from one of the pipes, and he noted poorly done plumbingfrom previous work, stating that the certain pipes should be replaced. The secondplumber, who came on October 16 with you, mentioned that a pipe was cracked and needed replacement. This not only contradicts your statement thatno leaks were found, but it also fails to acknowledge that the pipes in thegarage currently require maintenance.

 

In addition to these concerns, I noticed that yourprevious email did not mention a timeline for addressing the rootcause of the water intrusion. As the patio seems to be the mainsource of water entering the unit, it’s essential that this issue is fixed toprevent ongoing damage. Can you provide an update on when the patio will beaddressed, and if there is a plan in place to resolve the water intrusion atits source?

I want to clarify that our requests for repairs are not recent, as you stated. We initially reported water intrusion in the entryway/living room nearly one year ago on February 4, 2024. The patio has been an ongoing concern, and the garage pipes were reported on September 20, 2024. We have repeatedly provided videos and pictures to show the damage. We have also had technicians, contractors and plumbers come to make assessments, yet no repairs have been scheduled, no timeline has been given, and no resolution has been provided.

Water intrusion and lack of proper weatherproofing are habitability violations under California state law. With worsening weather conditions and increasing damage, I am formally requesting an immediate and comprehensive mold inspection at your expense.

Please provide a clear timeline for these necessary and long overdue repairs, not just a list of companies you have contacted.

when rain is not in the forecast?

Dean is available  to move sandbags on:

1. 2/17/25 between 5:30 and 6:30pm or
2. 2/18/25 between 5:30 and 6:30pm .

If you prefer to keep the sandbags  in place, that is fine with us as well.

Thank you for acknowledging receipt of the lease termination, as specified in Section 2B of the lease agreement, and the inspection/walk-through request.  
Due to the lease ending on September 8, 2024, we are not requiring you to comply with the process for requesting reasonable accommodation of an emotional support animal.
If you would like to formalize this request, you will need to provide a letter from a licensed healthcare professional explaining the need.   
   
   - This letter does not need to provide a diagnosis or describe the condition in extensive detail
   - This letter should be signed and dated on letterhead which provides the contact and license information of the healthcare professional

The notice sent on June 19, 2024, clearly stated a vacate date of September 15, 2024, and included specific terms. In contrast, the notice sent on August 23, 2024, lists a different vacate date of September 8, 2024, along with additional updated terms.

Given that these notices contain different vacate dates and terms, they are entirely separate and different notices. The notice provided on August 23, 2024, cannot reasonably be considered a “reminder” of the original notice, as it alters both the vacate date and the terms.

Unless you are indicating that you have decided to change the original notice’s vacate date and terms and are now attempting to pass the August 23, 2024, notice as a continuation of the original notice from June 19, 2024.


Can you please confirm which notice is in effect? Is it the first notice sent on June 19, 2024 or the second notice sent on August 23, 2024?



Sincerely,

Jennifer Burbank

To clarify, the vacate day of 9/8/24 is in accordance with the original lease. 
In the first communication sent on June 19, 2024 you were provided a greater than 60-day notice that the lease would not be renewed. The communication sent August 23, 2024 was only provided as a reminder and in no way supersedes the original notification. 
As stated in the August 23,2024 email, we are more than willing to consider your request for more time, however that needs to be communicated clearly so that an agreement can be reached. You are welcome to stay until September 15,2024 if that is your preference. Would that be your preference?

Thank you for acknowledging receipt of the lease termination, as specified in Section 2B of the lease agreement, and the inspection/walk-through request.  
Due to the lease ending on September 8, 2024, we are not requiring you to comply with the process for requesting reasonable accommodation of an emotional support animal.
If you would like to formalize this request, you will need to provide a letter from a licensed healthcare professional explaining the need.   
   
   - This letter does not need to provide a diagnosis or describe the condition in extensive detail
   - This letter should be signed and dated on letterhead which provides the contact and license information of the healthcare professional
   - The original, signed letter should be made available, if requested

Again, to clarify, if you would like to formalize the accommodation, that is your right.

Thank you for acknowledging receipt of the lease termination, as specified in Section 2B of the lease agreement, and the inspection/walk-through request.  
Due to the lease ending on September 8, 2024, we are not requiring you to comply with the process for requesting reasonable accommodation of an emotional support animal.
If you would like to formalize this request, you will need to provide a letter from a licensed healthcare professional explaining the need.   
   
   - This letter does not need to provide a diagnosis or describe the condition in extensive detail
   - This letter should be signed and dated on letterhead which provides the contact and license information of the healthcare professional

Again, to clarify, if you would like to formalize the accommodation, that is your right.

Dear Vicki and Brad,




I want to clarify the Fair Housing Act protects my right to reasonable accommodations without additional requirements. The approval of my emotional support animal is not dependent on this document. 




That said, I am willing to sign the addendum in good faith, as a gesture of cooperation, not out of legal obligation. Please note that signing this addendum does not change or modify the terms of the initial lease agreement in any way. I trust this will formalize the accommodation and ensure clarity for both parties moving forward.




Additionally, I would like to follow up on the status of the non-renewal notification. Please confirm whether it is still in effect, and if so, on what grounds.

I want to clarify that, under the Fair Housing Act (FHA), I’m not required to sign additional documents for my emotional support animal to be approved. Approval should be based on the documentation I’ve already provided.


I’d also appreciate an update on the status of the non-renewal notice from June 19, 2024. Since my emotional support animal has been disclosed and a formal request made, the no-animal policy no longer applies as a reason for non-renewal. Additionally, the alteration was acknowledged on May 22, 2024, with no further action requested. Given these points, I’m hoping you can confirm whether the non-renewal is still in effect and, if so, on what grounds.

Section 13 of the signed lease states that no animal or pet shall be kept on or about the premises without our prior written consent. If this process had been followed originally, we would have asked for the ATCA to be completed.  It is standard practice and protects both you as the tenant and us as the landlords.   
Secondly, the dog is already on property so the accommodation approval is not really in question here. If there is a particular section of the agreement that you are not comfortable with, please be specific in letting us know.
Lastly, page 20 of the lease agreement outlines why the property located at 518 N. Stoneman Ave. Alhambra CA 91801 is exempt from both rent cap and just cause eviction laws. The attached letter serves as your notice of this exemption.
Therefore, to answer your question, the non-renewal of the lease is still in effect and we are asking you to vacate the property as specified in the original notification dated June 19, 2024. As outlined in section 2A and B of the signed lease, if you fail to vacate on the specified date in September, the rent will increase 10% to $3,575 per month, starting October 1, 2024.

Regards,
Vicki and Brad

Due to the lease ending on September 8, 2024, we are not requiring you to comply with the process for requesting reasonable accommodation of an emotional support animal.
If you would like to formalize this request, you will need to provide a letter from a licensed healthcare professional explaining the need.

 Dear Vicki and Brad, I received your email regarding the lease termination and scheduling the walk-through. However, addressing my request for accommodation of my emotional support animal is important. Therefore, I would like to follow up on my previous email (sent August 5, 2024) in which I requested an accommodation for my emotional support animal. I have not yet received a response to that request and would appreciate confirmation of receipt and a response.  To clarify, I am requesting that my emotional support animal be accommodated under the terms of the lease. Please let me know if my request has been accepted and if you need any additional information.  I look forward to your prompt response to ensure this matter is addressed.

Sincerely, 
Jennifer Burbank

I want to clarify that, under the Fair Housing Act (FHA), I’m not required to sign additional documents for my emotional support animal to be approved. Approval should be based on the documentation I’ve already provided.


I’d also appreciate an update on the status of the non-renewal notice from June 19, 2024. Since my emotional support animal has been disclosed and a formal request made, the no-animal policy no longer applies as a reason for non-renewal. Additionally, the alteration was acknowledged on May 22, 2024, with no further action requested. Given these points, I’m hoping you can confirm whether the non-renewal is still in effect and, if so, on what grounds.


Sincerely,
Jennifer Burbank

I have emailed you the annual inspection report requested by you,  See below for response.  Regarding the baseboard, the one that was repaired is the one to the right side of your living room where the little table is located, it was detaching from the wall.  We did not see anything wrong with the baseboard to the left between the entry door and the restroom. The plumber and I inspected the patio on 10/16/2024 and turned on the water hose for 10 to 15 minutes on all sides including the area where the plants are located.  We also waited for a while to see if any water leaked inside your entry way and in the garage area.  No signs of water intrusion were found.  As for the toilet upstairs in the master bedroom, we also inspected and per the plumber there were no leak.  We did let James know about the toilet upstairs and found no leaks and James said he just wanted to make sure.  Per the property Owners, he as well inspected your toilet, tightened the bolts, and found no leaks at that time.  Again, if you feel the toilet is leaking, please notify me immediately and I will return to inspect during the leak.

For the pipes in garage area, no leaks were found either. The plumber I was with on 10/16 did suggest that there may be small cracks in the foundation that may result in some water seeping through. The area was inspected by the plumber, and all was found to be dry on the day we inspected it.

Good Morning Sally,

Good Afternoon Sally,




I am following up on the maintenance that was scheduled yesterday (October 16, 2024).

It appears that two areas in the stair well leading down to the garage were patched up where there was visible paint peeling. The weather stripping at the front door has been replaced or fixed and now the door easily opens and closes. I also noted the peeling on the ceiling in the living room was also patched up.


However, the baseboards that you have mentioned many times, have not been touched. The patio was again, visibly inspected, by another plumber with no repairs made or resolution. The toilet in the master bedroom has been reported as leaking since May 30, 2024. It was initially reported to Brad and Vicki Martinez. Brad inspected the toilet himself and stated the he noticed a small drip while flushing and tightened the bolt. He stated he would order a new seal and bolts as the ones installed were old. I have now reported this same issue to you through the online portal, and to my surprise, it has been dismissed and not been repaired. I am asking again, to replace the toilet or to fix the toilet in the master bedroom. Having to deal with toilet water on the floor, damaging my bath rug and potentially the floor is unacceptable, especially since it has been four months and a half since we initially reported this issue, and nearly a month (27 days) since we have brought it to your attention.


The water intrusion coming into the unit in the living room from under the flooring is concerning and it is highly important and urgent. I am requesting an immediate and specific timeline of when this issue is going to be addressed and repaired. I am also requesting an immediate and specific timeline of when the leaks and pipes/plumbing in the garage will be addressed and repaired. This has become a burden to us as tenants and it is unacceptable. As tenants we have rights and we will exercise our tenant rights if these issues are not addressed, repaired and all completed within a timely manner.

I will go ahead and make more maintenance requests for each issue that has failed to be repaired or has been negligently dismissed. My requests should not be ""canceled"" through the online portal or considered ""complete"" if they have not been addressed and repaired.

You have stated that all repairs need to be discussed with the landlords, Brad and Vicki Martinez, before moving forward. Are the delays and lack of repairs due to Brad and Vicki Martinez delaying repairs and refusing to make other repairs in the unit? Please advise on why the repairs are being delayed and or are being dismissed.




I am requesting the full report from the initial walk through inspection when the take over occurred, a full report of when the plumber came to the unit on September 28, 2024 (the plumber stated he would be writing a report to his supervisor) and any reports or notes that include a timeline of these issues being addressed and repaired, primarily the outdoor patio and the plumbing in the garage.

The water intrusion coming into the unit in the living room from under the flooring is concerning and it is highly important and urgent. I am requesting an immediate and specific timeline of when this issue is going to be addressed and repaired. I am also requesting an immediate and specific timeline of when the leaks and pipes/plumbing in the garage will be addressed and repaired. This has become a burden to us as tenants and it is unacceptable. As tenants we have rights and we will exercise our tenant rights if these issues are not addressed, repaired and all completed within a timely manner. 
I will go ahead and make more maintenance requests for each issue that has failed to be repaired or has been negligently dismissed. My requests should not be ""canceled"" through the online portal or considered ""complete"" if they have not been addressed and repaired.
You have stated that all repairs need to be discussed with the landlords, Brad and Vicki Martinez, before moving forward. Are the delays and lack of repairs due to Brad and Vicki Martinez delaying repairs and refusing to make other repairs in the unit? Please advise on why the repairs are being delayed and or are being dismissed.



I am requesting the full report from the initial walk through inspection when the take over occurred, a full report of when the plumber came to the unit on September 28, 2024 (the plumber stated he would be writing a report to his supervisor) and any reports or notes that include a timeline of these issues being addressed and repaired, primarily the outdoor patio and the plumbing in the garage.


Sincerely,
Jennifer Burbank

Brad,
 
  
 
  
 
Repairs are scheduled for tomorrow 10/16/2024 between 12:00pm – 5:00pm.  Also, I had another plumber trying to contact you guys and no response when can he go to inspect the flooring water that you noticed again?

Thank you for sending the reports.   If you are able to double check your email account to confirm Vicki or I were actually on the Oct 9th email, I would appreciate it.  We have zero record of an email from you on that date.
 
  
 
Additionally, we are requesting to see any responses from Jennifer on this topic, and what the next steps are for the pending repairs.

Any update on the formal mold inspection report and the rest of the pending repairs?

I checked the owner portal and didn't see anything there.

This is a text from the Mold inspection today by text

No updates on toilet
 
 
 
Once the results are in we will proceed with the repairs.

Hi Sally,
 
 
 
Just to include Vicki and Gail in the additional information you provided me over the phone:
 
 
    
   - The inspector and his inspection will be the authority on if there is a mold issue
   - The inspector confirmed the garage does not have mold and identified it as efflorescence and/or lime and it non-toxic
   - The inspector confirmed there is no visual evidence of mold nor any detectable mold/musty smell
   - James mentioned he would like to get additional testing done, at his expense, and mentioned drilling holes into the walls for this testing.   From my research, this is not standard practice, and I don't think we would support this idea.   
 
 
 
Please confirm this is your understanding as well.
 
 
 
Regards,
 

Brad

The weather stripping at the front door has been replaced or fixed and now the door easily opens and closes. I also noted the peeling on the ceiling in the living room was also patched up. &nbsp; &nbsp; However, the baseboards that you have mentioned many times, have not been touched. The patio was again, visibly inspected, by another plumber with no repairs made or resolution. The toilet in the master bedroom has been reported as leaking since May 30, 2024. It was initially reported to Brad and Vicki Martinez. Brad inspected the toilet himself and stated the he noticed a small drip while flushing and tightened the bolt. He stated he would order a new seal and bolts as the ones installed were old. I have now reported this same issue to you through the online portal, and to my surprise, it has been dismissed and not been repaired. I am asking again, to replace the toilet or to fix the toilet in the master bedroom. Having to deal with toilet water on the floor, damaging my bath rug and potentially the floor is unacceptable, especially since it has been four months and a half since we initially reported this issue, and nearly a month (27 days) since we have brought it to your attention.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The water intrusion coming into the unit in the living room from under the flooring is concerning and it is highly important and urgent. I am requesting an immediate and specific timeline of when this issue is going to be addressed and repaired. I am also requesting an immediate and specific timeline of when the leaks and pipes/plumbing in the garage will be addressed and repaired. This has become a burden to us as tenants and it is unacceptable. As tenants we have rights and we will exercise our tenant rights if these issues are not addressed, repaired and all completed within a timely manner.&nbsp; &nbsp; I will go ahead and make more maintenance requests for each issue that has failed to be repaired or has been negligently dismissed. My requests should not be ""canceled"" through the online portal or considered ""complete"" if they have not been addressed and repaired. &nbsp; You have stated that all repairs need to be discussed with the landlords, Brad and Vicki Martinez, before moving forward. Are the delays and lack of repairs due to Brad and Vicki Martinez delaying repairs and refusing to make other repairs in the unit? Please advise on why the repairs are being delayed and or are being dismissed. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am requesting the full report from the initial walk through inspection when the take over occurred, a full report of when the plumber came to the unit on September 28, 2024 (the plumber stated he would be writing a report to his supervisor) and any reports or notes that include a timeline of these issues being addressed and repaired, primarily the outdoor patio and the plumbing in the garage. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sincerely, &nbsp; Jennifer Burbank &nbsp; &nbsp;","urgent,legal,contract"

Hello,

You have two options for filing that. You can file a separate case for retaliation by going to this website and following the instructions Complaint Process | CRD<https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/complaintprocess/>, or you can provide me the details and I can investigate it alongside the current investigation. If you would like for me to investigate, please schedule a phone call with me to discuss the situation OR provide a detailed description of what happened, why you believe it is in retaliation, what you believe it is in retaliation of, etc.  I will also need any evidence you have such as the 60-day notice to vacate and any other evidence you feel is pertinent.

Good morning,



I have placed the summary of the respondent’s defense below. Please review and respond to this email with any response you may have. This can include details you feel are incorrect, missing or anything you would like to add. I would also like you to send me any evidence you have regarding the case, so emails, text messages, documents, etc. Anything that you feel relates to the case, please go ahead and send that to me. If you have any witnesses, please provide me with their contact information and what information you believe they can provide. Finally, I will be sending you a medical release form to be completed today so that I can contact your doctor. Please review and complete as soon as possible.



Respondent Defense summary:

Respondents denied all allegations. Respondents stated that on or around May 22nd they went for scheduled site visit to address some repairs. Respondents stated that on that visit they discovered that the glass shower enclosure from the upstairs bathroom had been removed without permission causing damage to the downstairs ceiling. Respondents stated that at that time they requested that you make no further changes to the property without prior approval of the owners. Respondents stated that you responded to this by telling them that you were just “waiting until the end of the lease to move out” and that you “would not be friendly going forward.” Respondents stated that on May 30th they went to repair a leaky toilet on the property where it was discovered that a bidet was installed without approval. Respondents stated that they decided at this time not to renew the lease and began to work on the 90-day notice. Respondents stated that they arranged a contractor to come and work on repairs at the property beginning June 17th and received confirmation from you that that would be fine. Respondents stated that when they and the contractor showed up to begin the work, they discovered a large dog on the property that they did not have any previous knowledge of. Respondents stated that they contacted you to ask about the dog and rearrange the start of the repairs as the dog could not be on the property. Respondents stated that you responded to them that the dog was your emotional support animal, but you did not submit any request for this animal previously or during this exchange. Respondents stated that on June 19th, they emailed you a letter of non-renewal of the lease, a lease violation for an animal on premises without seeking accommodation and unapproved repairs, alterations, or improvements as well as a 90-day notice which was not acknowledged by you at all. Respondents stated that they then mailed then to you which was delivered on July 15th. Respondents stated on August 5th they received a formal request for an emotional support animal in which they responded to let you know that they were not extending the lease, but you could provide a medical letter if you wished to formalize the process. Respondents stated that a letter was submitted by you from your healthcare professional on August 12th. Respondents stated that they asked you sign an animal terms and conditions addendum which was returned by you on August 21st. Respondents stated that they sent a confirmation of lease termination and non-renewal of the lease, and an offer was provided if you needed more time to make plans. Respondents stated that you entered a month-to-month contract as of August 30th.

Hello Lauren,



Thank you for letting me know. An email with all the necessary information would be just as good. Please go ahead and email us with the response from the respondents in further detail, if any, along with the next steps of the beginning of the investigation and what you may need from me and how to provide that to you or to whoever would be conducting the investigation.

Good afternoon,



I would need to know some additional details to determine if this could be something I can investigate with this complaint or if you would need to file a separate additional complaint for retaliation. Are you available for a phone call tomorrow at 2:00PM or 3:00 PM?

Good Morning,





I have additional concerns regarding my case. At this time and for quite some time, the unit we are renting has had maintenance issues that have either been ignored, brushed off as nothing or have been delayed drastically. At the moment, the respondent has hired a property management company to handle all aspects of the unit. We have reported numerous repairs such as water intrusion into the unit, signs of mildew and mold, and plumbing issues. The manager has stated that no repairs can be made unless they have approval of the respondent. We have slow active leaks in our garage which is over time damaging our items and not allowing us to use the space we pay for, a toilet that leaks, a patio that requires weather proofing, etc. We have reported these issues to the respondent before and now since having the new management company. None of those issues have been fixed. We have had 2 different plumbers take a look at the issues we reported and have each stated that pipes were improperly ""fixed"" and would need to be replaced, among other things they noticed. From September 5th up until now that we have brought all these issues to light, nothing has been done. There is no urgency or concern for these issues, if anything, the manager is very dismissive and has a bad attitude about the issues we bring up to her. I have already filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Health Department and the manager and respondent were aware of the complaint, yet nothing happened.



I strongly feel that the lack of urgency and the negligence is due to retaliation for asserting my rights and filing this exact complaint. I strongly believe this because the manager herself has said that nothing can be fixed without the approval of the respondents.



I cannot simply gather terms when I feel I am being retaliated against and am still living with overwhelming stress and anxiety because the unit I pay so much for, is not being taken care.



Are you able to assist with this matter since it feels like retaliation from this complaint?

Good morning,



It can begin at any time. As soon as I get a settlement offer from you, I will present that to the respondents. They will have the option to accept, decline or present a counteroffer. I will present you with the respondent’s response and then we will continue that process until a settlement is determined and an agreement can be signed. If someone declines to continue the process, I will just continue investigating the case. Please be aware that I am a neutral party in this, and I am just the middle man presenting the offers and creating the conciliation agreement for everyone to sign if you come to terms you agree with.

As far as conciliation, what is that process like and when would that begin?

Good afternoon,



We do not have a list of possible remedies or compensation options. The only thing I can really tell you is that most cases for our department settlement for somewhere between $2000-$5000 and we like all conciliation to include fair housing training or posting of a fair housing poster.  Outside of that, it is up to you. I would recommend thinking about what would make you feel better about this matter.

Good Afternoon,

I am open to conciliation, however, I have not yet finalized my terms. If the respondents have a settlement offer in mind, I would be open to reviewing and discussing it.

Additionally, could you provide any guidance or a list of possible remedies or compensation options that are typically considered in cases with similar allegations? This would help me better understand the potential resolution options as I continue to finalize my terms.

Thank you again for your assistance.

As part of the normal case processing, we offer mediation and conciliation for all of our cases.

Respondents stated that on June 19 th, they emailed you a letter of non-renewal of the lease, a lease violation for an animal on premises without seeking accommodation and unapproved repairs, alterations, or improvements as well as a 90-day notice which was not acknowledged by you at all.

Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognize the sender and know the content is safe. &nbsp; Good Morning, &nbsp; &nbsp; I have additional concerns regarding my case. At this time and for quite some time, the unit we are renting has had maintenance issues that have either been ignored, brushed off as nothing or have been delayed drastically. At the moment, the respondent has hired a property management company to handle all aspects of the unit. We have reported numerous repairs such as water intrusion into the unit, signs of mildew and mold, and plumbing issues. The manager has stated that no repairs can be made unless they have approval of the respondent. We have slow active leaks in our garage which is over time damaging our items and not allowing us to use the space we pay for, a toilet that leaks, a patio that requires weather proofing, etc. We have reported these issues to the respondent before and now since having the new management company. None of those issues have been fixed. We have had 2 different plumbers take a look at the issues we reported and have each stated that pipes were improperly ""fixed"" and would need to be replaced, among other things they noticed. From September 5th up until now that we have brought all these issues to light, nothing has been done. There is no urgency or concern for these issues, if anything, the manager is very dismissive and has a bad attitude about the issues we bring up to her. I have already filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Health Department and the manager and respondent were aware of the complaint, yet nothing happened. &nbsp; I strongly feel that the lack of urgency and the negligence is due to retaliation for asserting my rights and filing this exact complaint. I strongly believe this because the manager herself has said that nothing can be fixed without the approval of the respondents.&nbsp; &nbsp; I cannot simply gather terms when I feel I am being retaliated against and am still living with overwhelming stress and anxiety because the unit I pay so much for, is not being taken care.&nbsp; &nbsp; Are you able to assist with this matter since it feels like retaliation from this complaint? &nbsp; On Thursday, October 10, 2024 at 08:55:32 AM PDT, Witham, Lauren@CalCivilRights &lt; lauren.witham@calcivilrights.ca.gov &gt; wrote: &nbsp; &nbsp; Good morning, &nbsp; It can begin at any time.

Respondents stated that on or around May 22 nd they went for scheduled site visit to address some repairs. Respondents stated that on that visit they discovered that the glass shower enclosure from the upstairs bathroom had been removed without permission causing damage to the downstairs ceiling.

Respondents stated that on June 19 th, they emailed you a letter of non-renewal of the lease, a lease violation for an animal on premises without seeking accommodation and unapproved repairs, alterations, or improvements as well as a 90-day notice which was not acknowledged by you at all. Respondents stated that they then mailed then to you which was delivered on July 15 th .

Respondents stated that they asked you sign an animal terms and conditions addendum which was returned by you on August 21 st .

Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognize the sender and know the content is safe. &nbsp; Good Morning, &nbsp; &nbsp; I have additional concerns regarding my case. At this time and for quite some time, the unit we are renting has had maintenance issues that have either been ignored, brushed off as nothing or have been delayed drastically. At the moment, the respondent has hired a property management company to handle all aspects of the unit. We have reported numerous repairs such as water intrusion into the unit, signs of mildew and mold, and plumbing issues. The manager has stated that no repairs can be made unless they have approval of the respondent. We have slow active leaks in our garage which is over time damaging our items and not allowing us to use the space we pay for, a toilet that leaks, a patio that requires weather proofing, etc. We have reported these issues to the respondent before and now since having the new management company. None of those issues have been fixed. We have had 2 different plumbers take a look at the issues we reported and have each stated that pipes were improperly ""fixed"" and would need to be replaced, among other things they noticed. From September 5th up until now that we have brought all these issues to light, nothing has been done. There is no urgency or concern for these issues, if anything, the manager is very dismissive and has a bad attitude about the issues we bring up to her. I have already filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Health Department and the manager and respondent were aware of the complaint, yet nothing happened. &nbsp; I strongly feel that the lack of urgency and the negligence is due to retaliation for asserting my rights and filing this exact complaint. I strongly believe this because the manager herself has said that nothing can be fixed without the approval of the respondents.&nbsp; &nbsp; I cannot simply gather terms when I feel I am being retaliated against and am still living with overwhelming stress and anxiety because the unit I pay so much for, is not being taken care.&nbsp; &nbsp; Are you able to assist with this matter since it feels like retaliation from this complaint? &nbsp; On Thursday, October 10, 2024 at 08:55:32 AM PDT, Witham, Lauren@CalCivilRights &lt; lauren.witham@calcivilrights.ca.gov &gt; wrote: &nbsp; &nbsp; Good morning, &nbsp; It can begin at any time.

Good morning,



I have placed the summary of the respondent’s defense below. Please review and respond to this email with any response you may have. This can include details you feel are incorrect, missing or anything you would like to add. I would also like you to send me any evidence you have regarding the case, so emails, text messages, documents, etc. Anything that you feel relates to the case, please go ahead and send that to me. If you have any witnesses, please provide me with their contact information and what information you believe they can provide. Finally, I will be sending you a medical release form to be completed today so that I can contact your doctor. Please review and complete as soon as possible.



Respondent Defense summary:

Respondents denied all allegations. Respondents stated that on or around May 22nd they went for scheduled site visit to address some repairs. Respondents stated that on that visit they discovered that the glass shower enclosure from the upstairs bathroom had been removed without permission causing damage to the downstairs ceiling. Respondents stated that at that time they requested that you make no further changes to the property without prior approval of the owners. Respondents stated that you responded to this by telling them that you were just “waiting until the end of the lease to move out” and that you “would not be friendly going forward.” Respondents stated that on May 30th they went to repair a leaky toilet on the property where it was discovered that a bidet was installed without approval. Respondents stated that they decided at this time not to renew the lease and began to work on the 90-day notice. Respondents stated that they arranged a contractor to come and work on repairs at the property beginning June 17th and received confirmation from you that that would be fine. Respondents stated that when they and the contractor showed up to begin the work, they discovered a large dog on the property that they did not have any previous knowledge of. Respondents stated that they contacted you to ask about the dog and rearrange the start of the repairs as the dog could not be on the property. Respondents stated that you responded to them that the dog was your emotional support animal, but you did not submit any request for this animal previously or during this exchange. Respondents stated that on June 19th, they emailed you a letter of non-renewal of the lease, a lease violation for an animal on premises without seeking accommodation and unapproved repairs, alterations, or improvements as well as a 90-day notice which was not acknowledged by you at all. Respondents stated that they then mailed then to you which was delivered on July 15th. Respondents stated on August 5th they received a formal request for an emotional support animal in which they responded to let you know that they were not extending the lease, but you could provide a medical letter if you wished to formalize the process. Respondents stated that a letter was submitted by you from your healthcare professional on August 12th. Respondents stated that they asked you sign an animal terms and conditions addendum which was returned by you on August 21st. Respondents stated that they sent a confirmation of lease termination and non-renewal of the lease, and an offer was provided if you needed more time to make plans. Respondents stated that you entered a month-to-month contract as of August 30th.

Hello Lauren,



Thank you for letting me know. An email with all the necessary information would be just as good. Please go ahead and email us with the response from the respondents in further detail, if any, along with the next steps of the beginning of the investigation and what you may need from me and how to provide that to you or to whoever would be conducting the investigation.

Good afternoon,



I would need to know some additional details to determine if this could be something I can investigate with this complaint or if you would need to file a separate additional complaint for retaliation. Are you available for a phone call tomorrow at 2:00PM or 3:00 PM?

Good Morning,





I have additional concerns regarding my case. At this time and for quite some time, the unit we are renting has had maintenance issues that have either been ignored, brushed off as nothing or have been delayed drastically. At the moment, the respondent has hired a property management company to handle all aspects of the unit. We have reported numerous repairs such as water intrusion into the unit, signs of mildew and mold, and plumbing issues. The manager has stated that no repairs can be made unless they have approval of the respondent. We have slow active leaks in our garage which is over time damaging our items and not allowing us to use the space we pay for, a toilet that leaks, a patio that requires weather proofing, etc. We have reported these issues to the respondent before and now since having the new management company. None of those issues have been fixed. We have had 2 different plumbers take a look at the issues we reported and have each stated that pipes were improperly ""fixed"" and would need to be replaced, among other things they noticed. From September 5th up until now that we have brought all these issues to light, nothing has been done. There is no urgency or concern for these issues, if anything, the manager is very dismissive and has a bad attitude about the issues we bring up to her. I have already filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Health Department and the manager and respondent were aware of the complaint, yet nothing happened.



I strongly feel that the lack of urgency and the negligence is due to retaliation for asserting my rights and filing this exact complaint. I strongly believe this because the manager herself has said that nothing can be fixed without the approval of the respondents.



I cannot simply gather terms when I feel I am being retaliated against and am still living with overwhelming stress and anxiety because the unit I pay so much for, is not being taken care.



Are you able to assist with this matter since it feels like retaliation from this complaint?

Good morning,



It can begin at any time. As soon as I get a settlement offer from you, I will present that to the respondents. They will have the option to accept, decline or present a counteroffer. I will present you with the respondent’s response and then we will continue that process until a settlement is determined and an agreement can be signed. If someone declines to continue the process, I will just continue investigating the case. Please be aware that I am a neutral party in this, and I am just the middle man presenting the offers and creating the conciliation agreement for everyone to sign if you come to terms you agree with.

As far as conciliation, what is that process like and when would that begin?

Good afternoon,



We do not have a list of possible remedies or compensation options. The only thing I can really tell you is that most cases for our department settlement for somewhere between $2000-$5000 and we like all conciliation to include fair housing training or posting of a fair housing poster.  Outside of that, it is up to you. I would recommend thinking about what would make you feel better about this matter.

Good Afternoon,

I am open to conciliation, however, I have not yet finalized my terms. If the respondents have a settlement offer in mind, I would be open to reviewing and discussing it.

Additionally, could you provide any guidance or a list of possible remedies or compensation options that are typically considered in cases with similar allegations? This would help me better understand the potential resolution options as I continue to finalize my terms.

Thank you again for your assistance.

Good afternoon,



As part of the normal case processing, we offer mediation and conciliation for all of our cases. I have spoken with the respondents in this matter, and they are interested in potentially conciliating the case. They would like to know what your settlement terms would be for the case. Can you please let me know if you are interested in the conciliating the case and what your terms would be. If you have questions, please let me know.

Respondents stated that on or around May 22 nd they went for scheduled site visit to address some repairs. Respondents stated that on that visit they discovered that the glass shower enclosure from the upstairs bathroom had been removed without permission causing damage to the downstairs ceiling. Respondents stated that at that time they requested that you make no further changes to the property without prior approval of the owners. Respondents stated that you responded to this by telling them that you were just “waiting until the end of the lease to move out” and that you “would not be friendly going forward.” Respondents stated that on May 30 th they went to repair a leaky toilet on the property where it was discovered that a bidet was installed without approval. Respondents stated that they decided at this time not to renew the lease and began to work on the 90-day notice.

Respondents stated that when they and the contractor showed up to begin the work, they discovered a large dog on the property that they did not have any previous knowledge of. Respondents stated that they contacted you to ask about the dog and rearrange the start of the repairs as the dog could not be on the property. Respondents stated that you responded to them that the dog was your emotional support animal, but you did not submit any request for this animal previously or during this exchange. Respondents stated that on June 19 th, they emailed you a letter of non-renewal of the lease, a lease violation for an animal on premises without seeking accommodation and unapproved repairs, alterations, or improvements as well as a 90-day notice which was not acknowledged by you at all. Respondents stated that they then mailed then to you which was delivered on July 15 th . Respondents stated on August 5 th they received a formal request for an emotional support animal in which they responded to let you know that they were not extending the lease, but you could provide a medical letter if you wished to formalize the process. Respondents stated that a letter was submitted by you from your healthcare professional on August 12 th . Respondents stated that they asked you sign an animal terms and conditions addendum which was returned by you on August 21 st .

Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognize the sender and know the content is safe. &nbsp; Good Morning, &nbsp; &nbsp; I have additional concerns regarding my case. At this time and for quite some time, the unit we are renting has had maintenance issues that have either been ignored, brushed off as nothing or have been delayed drastically. At the moment, the respondent has hired a property management company to handle all aspects of the unit. We have reported numerous repairs such as water intrusion into the unit, signs of mildew and mold, and plumbing issues. The manager has stated that no repairs can be made unless they have approval of the respondent. We have slow active leaks in our garage which is over time damaging our items and not allowing us to use the space we pay for, a toilet that leaks, a patio that requires weather proofing, etc. We have reported these issues to the respondent before and now since having the new management company. None of those issues have been fixed. We have had 2 different plumbers take a look at the issues we reported and have each stated that pipes were improperly ""fixed"" and would need to be replaced, among other things they noticed. From September 5th up until now that we have brought all these issues to light, nothing has been done. There is no urgency or concern for these issues, if anything, the manager is very dismissive and has a bad attitude about the issues we bring up to her. I have already filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Health Department and the manager and respondent were aware of the complaint, yet nothing happened. &nbsp; I strongly feel that the lack of urgency and the negligence is due to retaliation for asserting my rights and filing this exact complaint. I strongly believe this because the manager herself has said that nothing can be fixed without the approval of the respondents.&nbsp; &nbsp; I cannot simply gather terms when I feel I am being retaliated against and am still living with overwhelming stress and anxiety because the unit I pay so much for, is not being taken care.&nbsp; &nbsp; Are you able to assist with this matter since it feels like retaliation from this complaint? &nbsp; On Thursday, October 10, 2024 at 08:55:32 AM PDT, Witham, Lauren@CalCivilRights &lt; lauren.witham@calcivilrights.ca.gov &gt; wrote: &nbsp; &nbsp; Good morning, &nbsp; It can begin at any time.

Would you like for me to send it in this email thread in various email replies or how would you recommend sending all the evidence to you?

I did not recieve the medical consent form in the previous email. May you send that to me please?

If I do not sign the medical consent form, am I able to submit medical notes, letters from my physician and/or my treatment plan as alternatives?

Good morning,



I have placed the summary of the respondent’s defense below. Please review and respond to this email with any response you may have. This can include details you feel are incorrect, missing or anything you would like to add. I would also like you to send me any evidence you have regarding the case, so emails, text messages, documents, etc. Anything that you feel relates to the case, please go ahead and send that to me. If you have any witnesses, please provide me with their contact information and what information you believe they can provide. Finally, I will be sending you a medical release form to be completed today so that I can contact your doctor. Please review and complete as soon as possible.



Respondent Defense summary:

Respondents denied all allegations. Respondents stated that on or around May 22nd they went for scheduled site visit to address some repairs. Respondents stated that on that visit they discovered that the glass shower enclosure from the upstairs bathroom had been removed without permission causing damage to the downstairs ceiling. Respondents stated that at that time they requested that you make no further changes to the property without prior approval of the owners. Respondents stated that you responded to this by telling them that you were just “waiting until the end of the lease to move out” and that you “would not be friendly going forward.” Respondents stated that on May 30th they went to repair a leaky toilet on the property where it was discovered that a bidet was installed without approval. Respondents stated that they decided at this time not to renew the lease and began to work on the 90-day notice. Respondents stated that they arranged a contractor to come and work on repairs at the property beginning June 17th and received confirmation from you that that would be fine. Respondents stated that when they and the contractor showed up to begin the work, they discovered a large dog on the property that they did not have any previous knowledge of. Respondents stated that they contacted you to ask about the dog and rearrange the start of the repairs as the dog could not be on the property. Respondents stated that you responded to them that the dog was your emotional support animal, but you did not submit any request for this animal previously or during this exchange. Respondents stated that on June 19th, they emailed you a letter of non-renewal of the lease, a lease violation for an animal on premises without seeking accommodation and unapproved repairs, alterations, or improvements as well as a 90-day notice which was not acknowledged by you at all. Respondents stated that they then mailed then to you which was delivered on July 15th. Respondents stated on August 5th they received a formal request for an emotional support animal in which they responded to let you know that they were not extending the lease, but you could provide a medical letter if you wished to formalize the process. Respondents stated that a letter was submitted by you from your healthcare professional on August 12th. Respondents stated that they asked you sign an animal terms and conditions addendum which was returned by you on August 21st. Respondents stated that they sent a confirmation of lease termination and non-renewal of the lease, and an offer was provided if you needed more time to make plans. Respondents stated that you entered a month-to-month contract as of August 30th.

Hello Lauren,



Thank you for letting me know. An email with all the necessary information would be just as good. Please go ahead and email us with the response from the respondents in further detail, if any, along with the next steps of the beginning of the investigation and what you may need from me and how to provide that to you or to whoever would be conducting the investigation.

Good Morning,





I have additional concerns regarding my case. At this time and for quite some time, the unit we are renting has had maintenance issues that have either been ignored, brushed off as nothing or have been delayed drastically. At the moment, the respondent has hired a property management company to handle all aspects of the unit. We have reported numerous repairs such as water intrusion into the unit, signs of mildew and mold, and plumbing issues. The manager has stated that no repairs can be made unless they have approval of the respondent. We have slow active leaks in our garage which is over time damaging our items and not allowing us to use the space we pay for, a toilet that leaks, a patio that requires weather proofing, etc. We have reported these issues to the respondent before and now since having the new management company. None of those issues have been fixed. We have had 2 different plumbers take a look at the issues we reported and have each stated that pipes were improperly ""fixed"" and would need to be replaced, among other things they noticed. From September 5th up until now that we have brought all these issues to light, nothing has been done. There is no urgency or concern for these issues, if anything, the manager is very dismissive and has a bad attitude about the issues we bring up to her. I have already filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Health Department and the manager and respondent were aware of the complaint, yet nothing happened.



I strongly feel that the lack of urgency and the negligence is due to retaliation for asserting my rights and filing this exact complaint. I strongly believe this because the manager herself has said that nothing can be fixed without the approval of the respondents.



I cannot simply gather terms when I feel I am being retaliated against and am still living with overwhelming stress and anxiety because the unit I pay so much for, is not being taken care.



Are you able to assist with this matter since it feels like retaliation from this complaint?

Good morning,



It can begin at any time. As soon as I get a settlement offer from you, I will present that to the respondents. They will have the option to accept, decline or present a counteroffer. I will present you with the respondent’s response and then we will continue that process until a settlement is determined and an agreement can be signed. If someone declines to continue the process, I will just continue investigating the case. Please be aware that I am a neutral party in this, and I am just the middle man presenting the offers and creating the conciliation agreement for everyone to sign if you come to terms you agree with.

Good afternoon,



We do not have a list of possible remedies or compensation options. The only thing I can really tell you is that most cases for our department settlement for somewhere between $2000-$5000 and we like all conciliation to include fair housing training or posting of a fair housing poster.  Outside of that, it is up to you. I would recommend thinking about what would make you feel better about this matter.

Good Afternoon,

I am open to conciliation, however, I have not yet finalized my terms. If the respondents have a settlement offer in mind, I would be open to reviewing and discussing it.

Additionally, could you provide any guidance or a list of possible remedies or compensation options that are typically considered in cases with similar allegations? This would help me better understand the potential resolution options as I continue to finalize my terms.

Thank you again for your assistance.

I did not recieve the medical consent form in the previous email. May you send that to me please?

Good morning, 
 
 
 
I have placed the summary of the respondent’s defense below. Please review and respond to this email with any response you may have. This can include details you feel are incorrect, missing or anything you would like to add. I would also like you to send me any evidence you have regarding the case, so emails, text messages, documents, etc. Anything that you feel relates to the case, please go ahead and send that to me. If you have any witnesses, please provide me with their contact information and what information you believe they can provide. Finally, I will be sending you a medical release form to be completed today so that I can contact your doctor. Please review and complete as soon as possible.
 
 
 
Respondent Defense summary:     
 
Respondents denied all allegations. Respondents stated that on or around May 22nd they went for scheduled site visit to address some repairs. Respondents stated that on that visit they discovered that the glass shower enclosure from the upstairs bathroom had been removed without permission causing damage to the downstairs ceiling. Respondents stated that at that time they requested that you make no further changes to the property without prior approval of the owners. Respondents stated that you responded to this by telling them that you were just “waiting until the end of the lease to move out” and that you “would not be friendly going forward.” Respondents stated that on May 30th they went to repair a leaky toilet on the property where it was discovered that a bidet was installed without approval. Respondents stated that they decided at this time not to renew the lease and began to work on the 90-day notice. Respondents stated that they arranged a contractor to come and work on repairs at the property beginning June 17th and received confirmation from you that that would be fine. Respondents stated that when they and the contractor showed up to begin the work, they discovered a large dog on the property that they did not have any previous knowledge of. Respondents stated that they contacted you to ask about the dog and rearrange the start of the repairs as the dog could not be on the property. Respondents stated that you responded to them that the dog was your emotional support animal, but you did not submit any request for this animal previously or during this exchange. Respondents stated that on June 19th, they emailed you a letter of non-renewal of the lease, a lease violation for an animal on premises without seeking accommodation and unapproved repairs, alterations, or improvements as well as a 90-day notice which was not acknowledged by you at all. Respondents stated that they then mailed then to you which was delivered on July 15th. Respondents stated on August 5th they received a formal request for an emotional support animal in which they responded to let you know that they were not extending the lease, but you could provide a medical letter if you wished to formalize the process. Respondents stated that a letter was submitted by you from your healthcare professional on August 12th. Respondents stated that they asked you sign an animal terms and conditions addendum which was returned by you on August 21st. Respondents stated that they sent a confirmation of lease termination and non-renewal of the lease, and an offer was provided if you needed more time to make plans. Respondents stated that you entered a month-to-month contract as of August 30th.

Hello Lauren,
 
 
 
Thank you for letting me know. An email with all the necessary information would be just as good. Please go ahead and email us with the response from the respondents in further detail, if any, along with the next steps of the beginning of the investigation and what you may need from me and how to provide that to you or to whoever would be conducting the investigation. 
 
 
 
If I have any questions I will reach out to schedule a phone call, however for now I think e-mail works best.

Good Morning,
 
 
 
 
 
I have additional concerns regarding my case. At this time and for quite some time, the unit we are renting has had maintenance issues that have either been ignored, brushed off as nothing or have been delayed drastically. At the moment, the respondent has hired a property management company to handle all aspects of the unit. We have reported numerous repairs such as water intrusion into the unit, signs of mildew and mold, and plumbing issues. The manager has stated that no repairs can be made unless they have approval of the respondent. We have slow active leaks in our garage which is over time damaging our items and not allowing us to use the space we pay for, a toilet that leaks, a patio that requires weather proofing, etc. We have reported these issues to the respondent before and now since having the new management company. None of those issues have been fixed. We have had 2 different plumbers take a look at the issues we reported and have each stated that pipes were improperly ""fixed"" and would need to be replaced, among other things they noticed. From September 5th up until now that we have brought all these issues to light, nothing has been done. There is no urgency or concern for these issues, if anything, the manager is very dismissive and has a bad attitude about the issues we bring up to her. I have already filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Health Department and the manager and respondent were aware of the complaint, yet nothing happened.
 
 
 
I strongly feel that the lack of urgency and the negligence is due to retaliation for asserting my rights and filing this exact complaint. I strongly believe this because the manager herself has said that nothing can be fixed without the approval of the respondents. 
 
 
 
I cannot simply gather terms when I feel I am being retaliated against and am still living with overwhelming stress and anxiety because the unit I pay so much for, is not being taken care. 
 
 
 
Are you able to assist with this matter since it feels like retaliation from this complaint?

Good morning,
 
 
 
It can begin at any time. As soon as I get a settlement offer from you, I will present that to the respondents. They will have the option to accept, decline or present a counteroffer. I will present you with the respondent’s response and then we will continue that process until a settlement is determined and an agreement can be signed. If someone declines to continue the process, I will just continue investigating the case. Please be aware that I am a neutral party in this, and I am just the middle man presenting the offers and creating the conciliation agreement for everyone to sign if you come to terms you agree with.

Thank you for that information Lauren.
 
 
 
As far as conciliation, what is that process like and when would that begin?

Good afternoon,
 
 
 
We do not have a list of possible remedies or compensation options. The only thing I can really tell you is that most cases for our department settlement for somewhere between $2000-$5000 and we like all conciliation to include fair housing training or posting of a fair housing poster.  Outside of that, it is up to you. I would recommend thinking about what would make you feel better about this matter.

Good Afternoon,
 
I am open to conciliation, however, I have not yet finalized my terms. If the respondents have a settlement offer in mind, I would be open to reviewing and discussing it.
 
Additionally, could you provide any guidance or a list of possible remedies or compensation options that are typically considered in cases with similar allegations? This would help me better understand the potential resolution options as I continue to finalize my terms.
 
Thank you again for your assistance.

Good afternoon,
 
 
 
As part of the normal case processing, we offer mediation and conciliation for all of our cases. I have spoken with the respondents in this matter, and they are interested in potentially conciliating the case. They would like to know what your settlement terms would be for the case. Can you please let me know if you are interested in the conciliating the case and what your terms would be. If you have questions, please let me know.

A lot of the materials or evidence I have to submit will not all fit in one email response. 
Would you like for me to send it in this email thread in various email replies or how would you recommend sending all the evidence to you? 
I did not recieve the medical consent form in the previous email. May you send that to me please? 
If I do not sign the medical consent form, am I able to submit medical notes, letters from my physician and/or my treatment plan as alternatives?

Good morning, 
 
 
 
I have placed the summary of the respondent’s defense below. Please review and respond to this email with any response you may have. This can include details you feel are incorrect, missing or anything you would like to add. I would also like you to send me any evidence you have regarding the case, so emails, text messages, documents, etc. Anything that you feel relates to the case, please go ahead and send that to me. If you have any witnesses, please provide me with their contact information and what information you believe they can provide. Finally, I will be sending you a medical release form to be completed today so that I can contact your doctor. Please review and complete as soon as possible.
 
 
 
Respondent Defense summary:     
 
Respondents denied all allegations. Respondents stated that on or around May 22nd they went for scheduled site visit to address some repairs. Respondents stated that on that visit they discovered that the glass shower enclosure from the upstairs bathroom had been removed without permission causing damage to the downstairs ceiling. Respondents stated that at that time they requested that you make no further changes to the property without prior approval of the owners. Respondents stated that you responded to this by telling them that you were just “waiting until the end of the lease to move out” and that you “would not be friendly going forward.” Respondents stated that on May 30th they went to repair a leaky toilet on the property where it was discovered that a bidet was installed without approval. Respondents stated that they decided at this time not to renew the lease and began to work on the 90-day notice. Respondents stated that they arranged a contractor to come and work on repairs at the property beginning June 17th and received confirmation from you that that would be fine. Respondents stated that when they and the contractor showed up to begin the work, they discovered a large dog on the property that they did not have any previous knowledge of. Respondents stated that they contacted you to ask about the dog and rearrange the start of the repairs as the dog could not be on the property. Respondents stated that you responded to them that the dog was your emotional support animal, but you did not submit any request for this animal previously or during this exchange. Respondents stated that on June 19th, they emailed you a letter of non-renewal of the lease, a lease violation for an animal on premises without seeking accommodation and unapproved repairs, alterations, or improvements as well as a 90-day notice which was not acknowledged by you at all. Respondents stated that they then mailed then to you which was delivered on July 15th. Respondents stated on August 5th they received a formal request for an emotional support animal in which they responded to let you know that they were not extending the lease, but you could provide a medical letter if you wished to formalize the process. Respondents stated that a letter was submitted by you from your healthcare professional on August 12th. Respondents stated that they asked you sign an animal terms and conditions addendum which was returned by you on August 21st. Respondents stated that they sent a confirmation of lease termination and non-renewal of the lease, and an offer was provided if you needed more time to make plans. Respondents stated that you entered a month-to-month contract as of August 30th.

Hello Lauren,
 
 
 
Thank you for letting me know. An email with all the necessary information would be just as good. Please go ahead and email us with the response from the respondents in further detail, if any, along with the next steps of the beginning of the investigation and what you may need from me and how to provide that to you or to whoever would be conducting the investigation. 
 
 
 
If I have any questions I will reach out to schedule a phone call, however for now I think e-mail works best.

Good afternoon,
 
 
 
 
 
Thank you for that information Lauren.
 
 
 
As far as conciliation, what is that process like and when would that begin?

Good afternoon,
 
 
 
We do not have a list of possible remedies or compensation options. The only thing I can really tell you is that most cases for our department settlement for somewhere between $2000-$5000 and we like all conciliation to include fair housing training or posting of a fair housing poster.  Outside of that, it is up to you. I would recommend thinking about what would make you feel better about this matter.

Good Afternoon,
 
I am open to conciliation, however, I have not yet finalized my terms. If the respondents have a settlement offer in mind, I would be open to reviewing and discussing it.
 
Additionally, could you provide any guidance or a list of possible remedies or compensation options that are typically considered in cases with similar allegations? This would help me better understand the potential resolution options as I continue to finalize my terms.

Respondents stated that they then mailed then to you which was delivered on July 15 th .

Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognize the sender and know the content is safe. &nbsp; Good Morning, &nbsp; &nbsp; I have additional concerns regarding my case. At this time and for quite some time, the unit we are renting has had maintenance issues that have either been ignored, brushed off as nothing or have been delayed drastically. At the moment, the respondent has hired a property management company to handle all aspects of the unit. We have reported numerous repairs such as water intrusion into the unit, signs of mildew and mold, and plumbing issues. The manager has stated that no repairs can be made unless they have approval of the respondent. We have slow active leaks in our garage which is over time damaging our items and not allowing us to use the space we pay for, a toilet that leaks, a patio that requires weather proofing, etc. We have reported these issues to the respondent before and now since having the new management company. None of those issues have been fixed. We have had 2 different plumbers take a look at the issues we reported and have each stated that pipes were improperly ""fixed"" and would need to be replaced, among other things they noticed. From September 5th up until now that we have brought all these issues to light, nothing has been done. There is no urgency or concern for these issues, if anything, the manager is very dismissive and has a bad attitude about the issues we bring up to her. I have already filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Health Department and the manager and respondent were aware of the complaint, yet nothing happened. &nbsp; I strongly feel that the lack of urgency and the negligence is due to retaliation for asserting my rights and filing this exact complaint. I strongly believe this because the manager herself has said that nothing can be fixed without the approval of the respondents.&nbsp; &nbsp; I cannot simply gather terms when I feel I am being retaliated against and am still living with overwhelming stress and anxiety because the unit I pay so much for, is not being taken care.&nbsp; &nbsp; Are you able to assist with this matter since it feels like retaliation from this complaint? &nbsp; On Thursday, October 10, 2024 at 08:55:32 AM PDT, Witham, Lauren@CalCivilRights &lt; lauren.witham@calcivilrights.ca.gov &gt; wrote: &nbsp; &nbsp; Good morning, &nbsp; It can begin at any time.

Good morning,

I have placed the summary of the respondent’s defense below. Please review and respond to this email with any response you may have. This can include details you feel are incorrect, missing or anything you would like to add. I would also like you to send me any evidence you have regarding the case, so emails, text messages, documents, etc. Anything that you feel relates to the case, please go ahead and send that to me. If you have any witnesses, please provide me with their contact information and what information you believe they can provide. Finally, I will be sending you a medical release form to be completed today so that I can contact your doctor. Please review and complete as soon as possible.

Respondent Defense summary:
Respondents denied all allegations. Respondents stated that on or around May 22nd they went for scheduled site visit to address some repairs. Respondents stated that on that visit they discovered that the glass shower enclosure from the upstairs bathroom had been removed without permission causing damage to the downstairs ceiling. Respondents stated that at that time they requested that you make no further changes to the property without prior approval of the owners. Respondents stated that you responded to this by telling them that you were just “waiting until the end of the lease to move out” and that you “would not be friendly going forward.” Respondents stated that on May 30th they went to repair a leaky toilet on the property where it was discovered that a bidet was installed without approval. Respondents stated that they decided at this time not to renew the lease and began to work on the 90-day notice. Respondents stated that they arranged a contractor to come and work on repairs at the property beginning June 17th and received confirmation from you that that would be fine. Respondents stated that when they and the contractor showed up to begin the work, they discovered a large dog on the property that they did not have any previous knowledge of. Respondents stated that they contacted you to ask about the dog and rearrange the start of the repairs as the dog could not be on the property. Respondents stated that you responded to them that the dog was your emotional support animal, but you did not submit any request for this animal previously or during this exchange. Respondents stated that on June 19th, they emailed you a letter of non-renewal of the lease, a lease violation for an animal on premises without seeking accommodation and unapproved repairs, alterations, or improvements as well as a 90-day notice which was not acknowledged by you at all. Respondents stated that they then mailed then to you which was delivered on July 15th. Respondents stated on August 5th they received a formal request for an emotional support animal in which they responded to let you know that they were not extending the lease, but you could provide a medical letter if you wished to formalize the process. Respondents stated that a letter was submitted by you from your healthcare professional on August 12th. Respondents stated that they asked you sign an animal terms and conditions addendum which was returned by you on August 21st. Respondents stated that they sent a confirmation of lease termination and non-renewal of the lease, and an offer was provided if you needed more time to make plans. Respondents stated that you entered a month-to-month contract as of August 30th.

Hello Lauren,

Thank you for letting me know. An email with all the necessary information would be just as good. Please go ahead and email us with the response from the respondents in further detail, if any, along with the next steps of the beginning of the investigation and what you may need from me and how to provide that to you or to whoever would be conducting the investigation.

If I have any questions I will reach out to schedule a phone call, however for now I think e-mail works best.

Thank you! I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Good morning Lauren,


I’m following up on the missed call you had set up for us for 12/9 at 11am. I called to leave a voicemail and followed up with an email as well and haven’t heard back. Please let me know if you are still going to call to speak with me regarding the case and the response you received from the respondents.

My cell phone number is 323-336-7829.

An email response would suffice as well. I want to ensure I know what the status of the case is and what to expect next.

Good Morning,





I have additional concerns regarding my case. At this time and for quite some time, the unit we are renting has had maintenance issues that have either been ignored, brushed off as nothing or have been delayed drastically. At the moment, the respondent has hired a property management company to handle all aspects of the unit. We have reported numerous repairs such as water intrusion into the unit, signs of mildew and mold, and plumbing issues. The manager has stated that no repairs can be made unless they have approval of the respondent. We have slow active leaks in our garage which is over time damaging our items and not allowing us to use the space we pay for, a toilet that leaks, a patio that requires weather proofing, etc. We have reported these issues to the respondent before and now since having the new management company. None of those issues have been fixed. We have had 2 different plumbers take a look at the issues we reported and have each stated that pipes were improperly ""fixed"" and would need to be replaced, among other things they noticed. From September 5th up until now that we have brought all these issues to light, nothing has been done. There is no urgency or concern for these issues, if anything, the manager is very dismissive and has a bad attitude about the issues we bring up to her. I have already filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Health Department and the manager and respondent were aware of the complaint, yet nothing happened.



I strongly feel that the lack of urgency and the negligence is due to retaliation for asserting my rights and filing this exact complaint. I strongly believe this because the manager herself has said that nothing can be fixed without the approval of the respondents.



I cannot simply gather terms when I feel I am being retaliated against and am still living with overwhelming stress and anxiety because the unit I pay so much for, is not being taken care.



Are you able to assist with this matter since it feels like retaliation from this complaint?

Good morning,



It can begin at any time. As soon as I get a settlement offer from you, I will present that to the respondents. They will have the option to accept, decline or present a counteroffer. I will present you with the respondent’s response and then we will continue that process until a settlement is determined and an agreement can be signed. If someone declines to continue the process, I will just continue investigating the case. Please be aware that I am a neutral party in this, and I am just the middle man presenting the offers and creating the conciliation agreement for everyone to sign if you come to terms you agree with.

We do not have a list of possible remedies or compensation options. The only thing I can really tell you is that most cases for our department settlement for somewhere between $2000-$5000 and we like all conciliation to include fair housing training or posting of a fair housing poster.  Outside of that, it is up to you. I would recommend thinking about what would make you feel better about this matter.

I am open to conciliation, however, I have not yet finalized my terms. If the respondents have a settlement offer in mind, I would be open to reviewing and discussing it.

Additionally, could you provide any guidance or a list of possible remedies or compensation options that are typically considered in cases with similar allegations? This would help me better understand the potential resolution options as I continue to finalize my terms.

Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognize the sender and know the content is safe. &nbsp; Good Morning, &nbsp; &nbsp; I have additional concerns regarding my case. At this time and for quite some time, the unit we are renting has had maintenance issues that have either been ignored, brushed off as nothing or have been delayed drastically. At the moment, the respondent has hired a property management company to handle all aspects of the unit. We have reported numerous repairs such as water intrusion into the unit, signs of mildew and mold, and plumbing issues. The manager has stated that no repairs can be made unless they have approval of the respondent. We have slow active leaks in our garage which is over time damaging our items and not allowing us to use the space we pay for, a toilet that leaks, a patio that requires weather proofing, etc. We have reported these issues to the respondent before and now since having the new management company. None of those issues have been fixed. We have had 2 different plumbers take a look at the issues we reported and have each stated that pipes were improperly ""fixed"" and would need to be replaced, among other things they noticed. From September 5th up until now that we have brought all these issues to light, nothing has been done. There is no urgency or concern for these issues, if anything, the manager is very dismissive and has a bad attitude about the issues we bring up to her. I have already filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Health Department and the manager and respondent were aware of the complaint, yet nothing happened. &nbsp; I strongly feel that the lack of urgency and the negligence is due to retaliation for asserting my rights and filing this exact complaint. I strongly believe this because the manager herself has said that nothing can be fixed without the approval of the respondents.&nbsp; &nbsp; I cannot simply gather terms when I feel I am being retaliated against and am still living with overwhelming stress and anxiety because the unit I pay so much for, is not being taken care.&nbsp; &nbsp; Are you able to assist with this matter since it feels like retaliation from this complaint? &nbsp; On Thursday, October 10, 2024 at 08:55:32 AM PDT, Witham, Lauren@CalCivilRights &lt; lauren.witham@calcivilrights.ca.gov &gt; wrote: &nbsp; &nbsp; Good morning, &nbsp; It can begin at any time.

I have placed the summary of the respondent’s defense below. Please review and respond to this email with any response you may have. This can include details you feel are incorrect, missing or anything you would like to add. I would also like you to send me any evidence you have regarding the case, so emails, text messages, documents, etc. Anything that you feel relates to the case, please go ahead and send that to me. If you have any witnesses, please provide me with their contact information and what information you believe they can provide. Finally, I will be sending you a medical release form to be completed today so that I can contact your doctor. Please review and complete as soon as possible.

Respondent Defense summary:
Respondents denied all allegations. Respondents stated that on or around May 22nd they went for scheduled site visit to address some repairs. Respondents stated that on that visit they discovered that the glass shower enclosure from the upstairs bathroom had been removed without permission causing damage to the downstairs ceiling. Respondents stated that at that time they requested that you make no further changes to the property without prior approval of the owners. Respondents stated that you responded to this by telling them that you were just “waiting until the end of the lease to move out” and that you “would not be friendly going forward.” Respondents stated that on May 30th they went to repair a leaky toilet on the property where it was discovered that a bidet was installed without approval. Respondents stated that they decided at this time not to renew the lease and began to work on the 90-day notice. Respondents stated that they arranged a contractor to come and work on repairs at the property beginning June 17th and received confirmation from you that that would be fine. Respondents stated that when they and the contractor showed up to begin the work, they discovered a large dog on the property that they did not have any previous knowledge of. Respondents stated that they contacted you to ask about the dog and rearrange the start of the repairs as the dog could not be on the property. Respondents stated that you responded to them that the dog was your emotional support animal, but you did not submit any request for this animal previously or during this exchange. Respondents stated that on June 19th, they emailed you a letter of non-renewal of the lease, a lease violation for an animal on premises without seeking accommodation and unapproved repairs, alterations, or improvements as well as a 90-day notice which was not acknowledged by you at all. Respondents stated that they then mailed then to you which was delivered on July 15th. Respondents stated on August 5th they received a formal request for an emotional support animal in which they responded to let you know that they were not extending the lease, but you could provide a medical letter if you wished to formalize the process. Respondents stated that a letter was submitted by you from your healthcare professional on August 12th. Respondents stated that they asked you sign an animal terms and conditions addendum which was returned by you on August 21st. Respondents stated that they sent a confirmation of lease termination and non-renewal of the lease, and an offer was provided if you needed more time to make plans. Respondents stated that you entered a month-to-month contract as of August 30th.

I would need to know some additional details to determine if this could be something I can investigate with this complaint or if you would need to file a separate additional complaint for retaliation. Are you available for a phone call tomorrow at 2:00PM or 3:00 PM?

Good Morning,





I have additional concerns regarding my case. At this time and for quite some time, the unit we are renting has had maintenance issues that have either been ignored, brushed off as nothing or have been delayed drastically. At the moment, the respondent has hired a property management company to handle all aspects of the unit. We have reported numerous repairs such as water intrusion into the unit, signs of mildew and mold, and plumbing issues. The manager has stated that no repairs can be made unless they have approval of the respondent. We have slow active leaks in our garage which is over time damaging our items and not allowing us to use the space we pay for, a toilet that leaks, a patio that requires weather proofing, etc. We have reported these issues to the respondent before and now since having the new management company. None of those issues have been fixed. We have had 2 different plumbers take a look at the issues we reported and have each stated that pipes were improperly ""fixed"" and would need to be replaced, among other things they noticed. From September 5th up until now that we have brought all these issues to light, nothing has been done. There is no urgency or concern for these issues, if anything, the manager is very dismissive and has a bad attitude about the issues we bring up to her. I have already filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Health Department and the manager and respondent were aware of the complaint, yet nothing happened.



I strongly feel that the lack of urgency and the negligence is due to retaliation for asserting my rights and filing this exact complaint. I strongly believe this because the manager herself has said that nothing can be fixed without the approval of the respondents.



I cannot simply gather terms when I feel I am being retaliated against and am still living with overwhelming stress and anxiety because the unit I pay so much for, is not being taken care.



Are you able to assist with this matter since it feels like retaliation from this complaint?

Good morning,



It can begin at any time. As soon as I get a settlement offer from you, I will present that to the respondents. They will have the option to accept, decline or present a counteroffer. I will present you with the respondent’s response and then we will continue that process until a settlement is determined and an agreement can be signed. If someone declines to continue the process, I will just continue investigating the case. Please be aware that I am a neutral party in this, and I am just the middle man presenting the offers and creating the conciliation agreement for everyone to sign if you come to terms you agree with.

Thank you for that information Lauren.



As far as conciliation, what is that process like and when would that begin?

Good afternoon,



We do not have a list of possible remedies or compensation options. The only thing I can really tell you is that most cases for our department settlement for somewhere between $2000-$5000 and we like all conciliation to include fair housing training or posting of a fair housing poster.  Outside of that, it is up to you. I would recommend thinking about what would make you feel better about this matter.

I am open to conciliation, however, I have not yet finalized my terms. If the respondents have a settlement offer in mind, I would be open to reviewing and discussing it.

Additionally, could you provide any guidance or a list of possible remedies or compensation options that are typically considered in cases with similar allegations? This would help me better understand the potential resolution options as I continue to finalize my terms.

Good morning Lauren,


I’m following up on the missed call you had set up for us for 12/9 at 11am. I called to leave a voicemail and followed up with an email as well and haven’t heard back. Please let me know if you are still going to call to speak with me regarding the case and the response you received from the respondents.

My cell phone number is 323-336-7829.

An email response would suffice as well. I want to ensure I know what the status of the case is and what to expect next.


Thank you.

Good morning,

I have received a response from the respondents, and they have declined this offer and declined to participate in conciliation any further. At this point, I will need to move forward with this investigation. I would like to set up a short phone call with you to discuss this case and the response that we received from the respondents. I have availability on Monday December 9th at 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM. Would you be available for either of those times?

Good Morning,





I have additional concerns regarding my case. At this time and for quite some time, the unit we are renting has had maintenance issues that have either been ignored, brushed off as nothing or have been delayed drastically. At the moment, the respondent has hired a property management company to handle all aspects of the unit. We have reported numerous repairs such as water intrusion into the unit, signs of mildew and mold, and plumbing issues. The manager has stated that no repairs can be made unless they have approval of the respondent. We have slow active leaks in our garage which is over time damaging our items and not allowing us to use the space we pay for, a toilet that leaks, a patio that requires weather proofing, etc. We have reported these issues to the respondent before and now since having the new management company. None of those issues have been fixed. We have had 2 different plumbers take a look at the issues we reported and have each stated that pipes were improperly ""fixed"" and would need to be replaced, among other things they noticed. From September 5th up until now that we have brought all these issues to light, nothing has been done. There is no urgency or concern for these issues, if anything, the manager is very dismissive and has a bad attitude about the issues we bring up to her. I have already filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Health Department and the manager and respondent were aware of the complaint, yet nothing happened.



I strongly feel that the lack of urgency and the negligence is due to retaliation for asserting my rights and filing this exact complaint. I strongly believe this because the manager herself has said that nothing can be fixed without the approval of the respondents.



I cannot simply gather terms when I feel I am being retaliated against and am still living with overwhelming stress and anxiety because the unit I pay so much for, is not being taken care.



Are you able to assist with this matter since it feels like retaliation from this complaint?

Good morning,



It can begin at any time. As soon as I get a settlement offer from you, I will present that to the respondents. They will have the option to accept, decline or present a counteroffer. I will present you with the respondent’s response and then we will continue that process until a settlement is determined and an agreement can be signed. If someone declines to continue the process, I will just continue investigating the case. Please be aware that I am a neutral party in this, and I am just the middle man presenting the offers and creating the conciliation agreement for everyone to sign if you come to terms you agree with.

Good afternoon,



We do not have a list of possible remedies or compensation options. The only thing I can really tell you is that most cases for our department settlement for somewhere between $2000-$5000 and we like all conciliation to include fair housing training or posting of a fair housing poster.  Outside of that, it is up to you. I would recommend thinking about what would make you feel better about this matter.

Good Afternoon,

I am open to conciliation, however, I have not yet finalized my terms. If the respondents have a settlement offer in mind, I would be open to reviewing and discussing it.

Additionally, could you provide any guidance or a list of possible remedies or compensation options that are typically considered in cases with similar allegations? This would help me better understand the potential resolution options as I continue to finalize my terms.

Thank you again for your assistance.

As part of the normal case processing, we offer mediation and conciliation for all of our cases. I have spoken with the respondents in this matter, and they are interested in potentially conciliating the case. They would like to know what your settlement terms would be for the case. Can you please let me know if you are interested in the conciliating the case and what your terms would be. If you have questions, please let me know.

At this time and for quite some time, the unit we are renting has had maintenance issues that have either been ignored, brushed off as nothing or have been delayed drastically. At the moment, the respondent has hired a property management company to handle all aspects of the unit. We have reported numerous repairs such as water intrusion into the unit, signs of mildew and mold, and plumbing issues. The manager has stated that no repairs can be made unless they have approval of the respondent. We have slow active leaks in our garage which is over time damaging our items and not allowing us to use the space we pay for, a toilet that leaks, a patio that requires weather proofing, etc. We have reported these issues to the respondent before and now since having the new management company. None of those issues have been fixed. We have had 2 different plumbers take a look at the issues we reported and have each stated that pipes were improperly ""fixed"" and would need to be replaced, among other things they noticed. From September 5th up until now that we have brought all these issues to light, nothing has been done. There is no urgency or concern for these issues, if anything, the manager is very dismissive and has a bad attitude about the issues we bring up to her. I have already filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Health Department and the manager and respondent were aware of the complaint, yet nothing happened. &nbsp; I strongly feel that the lack of urgency and the negligence is due to retaliation for asserting my rights and filing this exact complaint. I strongly believe this because the manager herself has said that nothing can be fixed without the approval of the respondents.&nbsp; &nbsp; I cannot simply gather terms when I feel I am being retaliated against and am still living with overwhelming stress and anxiety because the unit I pay so much for, is not being taken care.&nbsp; &nbsp; Are you able to assist with this matter since it feels like retaliation from this complaint? &nbsp; On Thursday, October 10, 2024 at 08:55:32 AM PDT, Witham, Lauren@CalCivilRights &lt; lauren.witham@calcivilrights.ca.gov &gt; wrote: &nbsp; &nbsp; Good morning, &nbsp; It can begin at any time.

Good Morning,





I have additional concerns regarding my case. At this time and for quite some time, the unit we are renting has had maintenance issues that have either been ignored, brushed off as nothing or have been delayed drastically. At the moment, the respondent has hired a property management company to handle all aspects of the unit. We have reported numerous repairs such as water intrusion into the unit, signs of mildew and mold, and plumbing issues. The manager has stated that no repairs can be made unless they have approval of the respondent. We have slow active leaks in our garage which is over time damaging our items and not allowing us to use the space we pay for, a toilet that leaks, a patio that requires weather proofing, etc. We have reported these issues to the respondent before and now since having the new management company. None of those issues have been fixed. We have had 2 different plumbers take a look at the issues we reported and have each stated that pipes were improperly ""fixed"" and would need to be replaced, among other things they noticed. From September 5th up until now that we have brought all these issues to light, nothing has been done. There is no urgency or concern for these issues, if anything, the manager is very dismissive and has a bad attitude about the issues we bring up to her. I have already filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Health Department and the manager and respondent were aware of the complaint, yet nothing happened.



I strongly feel that the lack of urgency and the negligence is due to retaliation for asserting my rights and filing this exact complaint. I strongly believe this because the manager herself has said that nothing can be fixed without the approval of the respondents.



I cannot simply gather terms when I feel I am being retaliated against and am still living with overwhelming stress and anxiety because the unit I pay so much for, is not being taken care.



Are you able to assist with this matter since it feels like retaliation from this complaint?

Good Morning,





I have additional concerns regarding my case. At this time and for quite some time, the unit we are renting has had maintenance issues that have either been ignored, brushed off as nothing or have been delayed drastically. At the moment, the respondent has hired a property management company to handle all aspects of the unit. We have reported numerous repairs such as water intrusion into the unit, signs of mildew and mold, and plumbing issues. The manager has stated that no repairs can be made unless they have approval of the respondent. We have slow active leaks in our garage which is over time damaging our items and not allowing us to use the space we pay for, a toilet that leaks, a patio that requires weather proofing, etc. We have reported these issues to the respondent before and now since having the new management company. None of those issues have been fixed. We have had 2 different plumbers take a look at the issues we reported and have each stated that pipes were improperly ""fixed"" and would need to be replaced, among other things they noticed. From September 5th up until now that we have brought all these issues to light, nothing has been done. There is no urgency or concern for these issues, if anything, the manager is very dismissive and has a bad attitude about the issues we bring up to her. I have already filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Health Department and the manager and respondent were aware of the complaint, yet nothing happened.



I strongly feel that the lack of urgency and the negligence is due to retaliation for asserting my rights and filing this exact complaint. I strongly believe this because the manager herself has said that nothing can be fixed without the approval of the respondents.



I cannot simply gather terms when I feel I am being retaliated against and am still living with overwhelming stress and anxiety because the unit I pay so much for, is not being taken care.



Are you able to assist with this matter since it feels like retaliation from this complaint?

Good morning,



It can begin at any time. As soon as I get a settlement offer from you, I will present that to the respondents. They will have the option to accept, decline or present a counteroffer. I will present you with the respondent’s response and then we will continue that process until a settlement is determined and an agreement can be signed. If someone declines to continue the process, I will just continue investigating the case. Please be aware that I am a neutral party in this, and I am just the middle man presenting the offers and creating the conciliation agreement for everyone to sign if you come to terms you agree with.

Good Morning,
 
 
 
 
 
I have additional concerns regarding my case. At this time and for quite some time, the unit we are renting has had maintenance issues that have either been ignored, brushed off as nothing or have been delayed drastically. At the moment, the respondent has hired a property management company to handle all aspects of the unit. We have reported numerous repairs such as water intrusion into the unit, signs of mildew and mold, and plumbing issues. The manager has stated that no repairs can be made unless they have approval of the respondent. We have slow active leaks in our garage which is over time damaging our items and not allowing us to use the space we pay for, a toilet that leaks, a patio that requires weather proofing, etc. We have reported these issues to the respondent before and now since having the new management company. None of those issues have been fixed. We have had 2 different plumbers take a look at the issues we reported and have each stated that pipes were improperly ""fixed"" and would need to be replaced, among other things they noticed. From September 5th up until now that we have brought all these issues to light, nothing has been done. There is no urgency or concern for these issues, if anything, the manager is very dismissive and has a bad attitude about the issues we bring up to her. I have already filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Health Department and the manager and respondent were aware of the complaint, yet nothing happened.
 
 
 
I strongly feel that the lack of urgency and the negligence is due to retaliation for asserting my rights and filing this exact complaint. I strongly believe this because the manager herself has said that nothing can be fixed without the approval of the respondents. 
 
 
 
I cannot simply gather terms when I feel I am being retaliated against and am still living with overwhelming stress and anxiety because the unit I pay so much for, is not being taken care. 
 
 
 
Are you able to assist with this matter since it feels like retaliation from this complaint?

Good morning,
 
 
 
It can begin at any time. As soon as I get a settlement offer from you, I will present that to the respondents. They will have the option to accept, decline or present a counteroffer. I will present you with the respondent’s response and then we will continue that process until a settlement is determined and an agreement can be signed. If someone declines to continue the process, I will just continue investigating the case. Please be aware that I am a neutral party in this, and I am just the middle man presenting the offers and creating the conciliation agreement for everyone to sign if you come to terms you agree with.

As far as conciliation, what is that process like and when would that begin?

Good afternoon,
 
 
 
We do not have a list of possible remedies or compensation options. The only thing I can really tell you is that most cases for our department settlement for somewhere between $2000-$5000 and we like all conciliation to include fair housing training or posting of a fair housing poster.  Outside of that, it is up to you. I would recommend thinking about what would make you feel better about this matter.

Good Afternoon,
 
I am open to conciliation, however, I have not yet finalized my terms. If the respondents have a settlement offer in mind, I would be open to reviewing and discussing it.
 
Additionally, could you provide any guidance or a list of possible remedies or compensation options that are typically considered in cases with similar allegations? This would help me better understand the potential resolution options as I continue to finalize my terms.
 
Thank you again for your assistance.

As part of the normal case processing, we offer mediation and conciliation for all of our cases. I have spoken with the respondents in this matter, and they are interested in potentially conciliating the case. They would like to know what your settlement terms would be for the case. Can you please let me know if you are interested in the conciliating the case and what your terms would be. If you have questions, please let me know.

Good Morning,





I have additional concerns regarding my case. At this time and for quite some time, the unit we are renting has had maintenance issues that have either been ignored, brushed off as nothing or have been delayed drastically. At the moment, the respondent has hired a property management company to handle all aspects of the unit. We have reported numerous repairs such as water intrusion into the unit, signs of mildew and mold, and plumbing issues. The manager has stated that no repairs can be made unless they have approval of the respondent. We have slow active leaks in our garage which is over time damaging our items and not allowing us to use the space we pay for, a toilet that leaks, a patio that requires weather proofing, etc. We have reported these issues to the respondent before and now since having the new management company. None of those issues have been fixed. We have had 2 different plumbers take a look at the issues we reported and have each stated that pipes were improperly ""fixed"" and would need to be replaced, among other things they noticed. From September 5th up until now that we have brought all these issues to light, nothing has been done. There is no urgency or concern for these issues, if anything, the manager is very dismissive and has a bad attitude about the issues we bring up to her. I have already filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Health Department and the manager and respondent were aware of the complaint, yet nothing happened.



I strongly feel that the lack of urgency and the negligence is due to retaliation for asserting my rights and filing this exact complaint. I strongly believe this because the manager herself has said that nothing can be fixed without the approval of the respondents.



I cannot simply gather terms when I feel I am being retaliated against and am still living with overwhelming stress and anxiety because the unit I pay so much for, is not being taken care.



Are you able to assist with this matter since it feels like retaliation from this complaint?

Good morning,



It can begin at any time. As soon as I get a settlement offer from you, I will present that to the respondents. They will have the option to accept, decline or present a counteroffer. I will present you with the respondent’s response and then we will continue that process until a settlement is determined and an agreement can be signed. If someone declines to continue the process, I will just continue investigating the case. Please be aware that I am a neutral party in this, and I am just the middle man presenting the offers and creating the conciliation agreement for everyone to sign if you come to terms you agree with.

We have had 2 different plumbers take a look at the issues we reported and have each stated that pipes were improperly ""fixed"" and would need to be replaced, among other things they noticed. From September 5th up until now that we have brought all these issues to light, nothing has been done. There is no urgency or concern for these issues, if anything, the manager is very dismissive and has a bad attitude about the issues we bring up to her. I have already filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Health Department and the manager and respondent were aware of the complaint, yet nothing happened.
 
 
 
I strongly feel that the lack of urgency and the negligence is due to retaliation for asserting my rights and filing this exact complaint. I strongly believe this because the manager herself has said that nothing can be fixed without the approval of the respondents. 
 
 
 
I cannot simply gather terms when I feel I am being retaliated against and am still living with overwhelming stress and anxiety because the unit I pay so much for, is not being taken care. 
 
 
 
Are you able to assist with this matter since it feels like retaliation from this complaint?

Good morning,
 
 
 
It can begin at any time. As soon as I get a settlement offer from you, I will present that to the respondents. They will have the option to accept, decline or present a counteroffer. I will present you with the respondent’s response and then we will continue that process until a settlement is determined and an agreement can be signed. If someone declines to continue the process, I will just continue investigating the case. Please be aware that I am a neutral party in this, and I am just the middle man presenting the offers and creating the conciliation agreement for everyone to sign if you come to terms you agree with.

We do not have a list of possible remedies or compensation options. The only thing I can really tell you is that most cases for our department settlement for somewhere between $2000-$5000 and we like all conciliation to include fair housing training or posting of a fair housing poster.  Outside of that, it is up to you. I would recommend thinking about what would make you feel better about this matter.

Good Morning,
 
 
 
 
 
I have additional concerns regarding my case. At this time and for quite some time, the unit we are renting has had maintenance issues that have either been ignored, brushed off as nothing or have been delayed drastically. At the moment, the respondent has hired a property management company to handle all aspects of the unit. We have reported numerous repairs such as water intrusion into the unit, signs of mildew and mold, and plumbing issues. The manager has stated that no repairs can be made unless they have approval of the respondent. We have slow active leaks in our garage which is over time damaging our items and not allowing us to use the space we pay for, a toilet that leaks, a patio that requires weather proofing, etc. We have reported these issues to the respondent before and now since having the new management company. None of those issues have been fixed. We have had 2 different plumbers take a look at the issues we reported and have each stated that pipes were improperly ""fixed"" and would need to be replaced, among other things they noticed. From September 5th up until now that we have brought all these issues to light, nothing has been done.

We do not have a list of possible remedies or compensation options.

Outside of that, it is up to you. I would recommend thinking about what would make you feel better about this matter.

Good afternoon, 
 
  
 
I would need to know some additional details to determine if this could be something I can investigate with this complaint or if you would need to file a separate additional complaint for retaliation. Are you available for a phone call tomorrow at 2:00PM or 3:00 PM?

Good Morning,
 
  
 
  
 
I have additional concerns regarding my case. At this time and for quite some time, the unit we are renting has had maintenance issues that have either been ignored, brushed off as nothing or have been delayed drastically. At the moment, the respondent has hired a property management company to handle all aspects of the unit. We have reported numerous repairs such as water intrusion into the unit, signs of mildew and mold, and plumbing issues. The manager has stated that no repairs can be made unless they have approval of the respondent. We have slow active leaks in our garage which is over time damaging our items and not allowing us to use the space we pay for, a toilet that leaks, a patio that requires weather proofing, etc. We have reported these issues to the respondent before and now since having the new management company. None of those issues have been fixed. We have had 2 different plumbers take a look at the issues we reported and have each stated that pipes were improperly ""fixed"" and would need to be replaced, among other things they noticed. From September 5th up until now that we have brought all these issues to light, nothing has been done. There is no urgency or concern for these issues, if anything, the manager is very dismissive and has a bad attitude about the issues we bring up to her. I have already filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Health Department and the manager and respondent were aware of the complaint, yet nothing happened.
 
  
 
I strongly feel that the lack of urgency and the negligence is due to retaliation for asserting my rights and filing this exact complaint. I strongly believe this because the manager herself has said that nothing can be fixed without the approval of the respondents. 
 
  
 
I cannot simply gather terms when I feel I am being retaliated against and am still living with overwhelming stress and anxiety because the unit I pay so much for, is not being taken care. 
 
  
 
Are you able to assist with this matter since it feels like retaliation from this complaint?

Good morning,
 
 
 
It can begin at any time. As soon as I get a settlement offer from you, I will present that to the respondents. They will have the option to accept, decline or present a counteroffer. I will present you with the respondent’s response and then we will continue that process until a settlement is determined and an agreement can be signed. If someone declines to continue the process, I will just continue investigating the case. Please be aware that I am a neutral party in this, and I am just the middle man presenting the offers and creating the conciliation agreement for everyone to sign if you come to terms you agree with.

Good morning, 
 
  
 
It can begin at any time. As soon as I get a settlement offer from you, I will present that to the respondents. They will have the option to accept, decline or present a counteroffer. I will present you with the respondent’s response and then we will continue that process until a settlement is determined and an agreement can be signed. If someone declines to continue the process, I will just continue investigating the case. Please be aware that I am a neutral party in this, and I am just the middle man presenting the offers and creating the conciliation agreement for everyone to sign if you come to terms you agree with.
 
  
 
Thank you,

Good afternoon, 
 
 
 
We do not have a list of possible remedies or compensation options. The only thing I can really tell you is that most cases for our department settlement for somewhere between $2000-$5000 and we like all conciliation to include fair housing training or posting of a fair housing poster.  Outside of that, it is up to you. I would recommend thinking about what would make you feel better about this matter.

I am open to conciliation, however, I have not yet finalized my terms. If the respondents have a settlement offer in mind, I would be open to reviewing and discussing it.
 
Additionally, could you provide any guidance or a list of possible remedies or compensation options that are typically considered in cases with similar allegations? This would help me better understand the potential resolution options as I continue to finalize my terms.

There is water underneath the floorboards in the entry way and restroom tiles. This is exactly what happened last year when it rained. This is also what has happened a few other times within the last year when it also rained. The garage continues to leak when it rains from the ceiling and the pipes I’ve previously reported since September 20, 2024 (20 weeks ago!) are still leaking and causing further damage to our personal belongings.&nbsp; I cannot stress how this violates Civil Code 1941.1. I am requesting immediate repairs to the root issue of the water intrusion in the unit and the plumbing in the garage. Making temporary and minor repairs to redirect the water flow is insufficient as it is not the root cause of the water intrusion.&nbsp; Please respond with your plan of action and again a timeline of repairs that are scheduled to fix the root issue of the water intrusion.

Due to the unresolved concern regarding whether you recorded inside the unit, on February 27, 2025, while my minor children were present, I am not comfortable with your presence in the unit. Therefore, I do not consent to you, Gail Houser, entering the unit at any time.

As there are multiple landlords or representatives, I request that any necessary visits or repairs be handled by someone other than you.

We are hopeful that you both will communicate more effectively as well, as Lotus Property Services Inc. had issues communicating with us in a timely manner, or at all.&nbsp; In our short tenure at 518 N. Stoneman, we are now moving forward with a third set of management team. The previous two have failed us as tenants and we are hoping that third times the charm.&nbsp; As mentioned above, we have pending items that I will address in a separate email regarding all maintenance. I do have expectations of them being addressed in a timely manner and in accordance with all state and county laws. Due to our ongoing housing discrimination case with Vicki and your trust, Calhoun Gail D Trust, I would like for all communication to be in writing, either via email or text. As far as the rent, please note that there is a limit of $500 to send to you via Zelle. Therefore, we will be sending a check via U.S. Mail.&nbsp; Sincerely, Jennifer Burbank On Nov 24, 2024, at 9:47 AM, Stoneman &lt;518stoneman@gmail.com&gt; wrote: ﻿ Dear Mr. and Mrs. Burbank,&nbsp; We hope this letter finds you well.

Please let me know if someone will be available to let me and the service
provider into the garage at the above indicated time.

2. We need to place *sandbags* this week prior to the rain. Can we come in
to reposition your existing bags and bring additional bags t*onight

*3. *Do you need *tarps or plastic storage tubs to protect items in the

And, in a follow-up to the conversation we had in person in the entryway
of 518 on Friday night, please let us know if water gets in during the

help in pinpointing any possible sources of water ingress/ allow repairs to
be targeted.
