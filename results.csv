You acknowledged seeing my previous email indicating this preference, yet you highly recommended that my husband (James Burbank) and I speak with you directly via phone. Despite my repeated statements that I was happy to communicate with you, I reiterated that I preferred to do so in writing. During our call, you mentioned a few times that speaking with me over the phone was a last resort and that it would be in my best interest to speak with you.

You stated that the owners are within their legal right to issue us a 60-day eviction notice, to which I stated the owners would need a valid reason to do so, and they don't have a valid reason. You then stated the owners do have a valid reason, as they are planning to put the unit on the market and sell because they no longer wish to deal with residential rentals. You reiterated that you are a last resort and you recommended speaking with you or being issued a 60-day eviction notice.

I asked for you to email me various times and dates with your availability to which you responded that you were available that same day to speak.

Before the call ended, we set up a tentative call scheduled for today, October 29, 2024 at 6:00 PM.

Hi Sally,



Just to include Vicki and Gail in the additional information you provided me over the phone:



  1.  The inspector and his inspection will be the authority on if there is a mold issue
  2.  The inspector confirmed the garage does not have mold and identified it as efflorescence and/or lime and it non-toxic
  3.  The inspector confirmed there is no visual evidence of mold nor any detectable mold/musty smell
  4.  James mentioned he would like to get additional testing done, at his expense, and mentioned drilling holes into the walls for this testing.   From my research, this is not standard practice, and I don't think we would support this idea.



Please confirm this is your understanding as well.



Regards,

Brad

This was denied by the tenant when the maintenance vendor went out in person.  I spoke to the tenant after, and she claimed she wanted the mold test before anything was done.  I have contacted the Inspector and notified them of the issue we had with the tenant for noncompliance, the Inspector is aware and instructed me to keep a log of the communication with the tenant, dates and time in which I have.  We are scheduled for this Wednesday October 2, 2024, to do the Air Test and I will also be there just in case any issues arise.  Tenant agreed to let us in for the testing, once that is completed, we can reschedule for the weather stripping and ceiling repair.

Due to the unresolved concern regarding whether you recorded inside the unit, on February 27, 2025, while my minor children were present, I am not comfortable with your presence in the unit. Therefore, I do not consent to you, Gail Houser, entering the unit at any time.

As there are multiple landlords or representatives, I request that any necessary visits or repairs be handled by someone other than you.

I would like clarification on whether you recorded inside the unit and if so, why. As you were leaving, you appeared to be holding your phone in a recording position while walking up the stairs from the garage and through the unit until you exited. My minor children were home at the time, and I take this matter seriously. Recording inside a private residence without consent is a violation of state law. If I do not receive a response with clarification, I will have to report this to law enforcement or the appropriate authorities.&nbsp; Jennifer Burbank On Mar 2, 2025, at 9:00 AM, Stoneman &lt;518stoneman@gmail.com&gt; wrote: Ôªø M/M Burbank,&nbsp; We are not able to accommodate the schedule requested&nbsp; in your email from March 1, 2025-&nbsp; &nbsp; "" March 2, 2025, between 10:00 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. &nbsp;"" for placement of tarps and sandbags in the patio area of 518 Stoneman .&nbsp; Gail Houser On Sat, Mar 1, 2025 at 11:11 PM Jen Barreda &lt; jenbarreda@yahoo.com &gt; wrote: Dean, If you believe that covering the planters and cracked tiles with sandbags is necessary to prevent water intrusion, you are welcome to do so on March 2, 2025, between 10:00 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. This does seem to indicate that you believe the patio is contributing to the issue, which we have raised multiple times.

You stated you would provide an update after Thursday‚Äôs repairs and we have not received any updates. Therefore I am requesting for an update. 

I am still waiting to hear any update on the pipe in the garage that has been leaking since September 20, 2024 and was reported multiple times. Additionally we are awaiting any updates on the patio and if you plan to address and fix the patio to prevent more water intrusion.

I am also requesting an update on any reports or findings from ServPro regarding the water moisture in the unit. 

I am also awaiting repairs on the floor that is bouncy/has a soft spot and the wall in the stairwell near the garage that has been peeling over time. 

Please respond with a timeline or schedule for all these repairs.

 gailcalhoun@gmail.com",Re: Notice to Enter Dwelling Unit,"Gail, I am following up regarding the entry for scheduled repairs on February 27, 2025, which was authorized between 10:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. You provided notice of this entry via email and left a physical notice at the door, yet you did not adhere to the timeframe stated in your own notice. It was observed that entry was made into the patio, which was not explicitly stated in any notice or my written authorization. This is in violation of California Civil Code ¬ß 1954. Additionally, the plumbers were left unsupervised inside the unit, raising serious security and safety concerns, which is also a violation of California Civil Code ¬ß 1954. The plumbers and Brad Martinez remained on the property past the authorized time frame of 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., another violation of California Civil Code ¬ß 1954. Despite the scheduled repairs, the pipe in the garage that has been leaking since September 20, 2024, remains unfixed. This issue has been reported multiple times, yet as of today, March 1, 2025, it has still not been repaired, in violation of California Civil Code ¬ß 1941.1. Later in the day, you arrived and requested entry into the unit. As a courtesy, this was allowed, but moving forward, this will not be permitted unless proper notice is given. There is no obligation to allow entry beyond the legally required notice, and given that Brad Martinez was already present earlier, any follow-up of repairs should have been coordinated with him instead of an unannounced visit. It was also observed that you were holding your phone in a manner that appeared to be recording while inside the unit. My minor children were present at the time, and we did not consent to any recording in the unit. I am requesting clarification regarding the content and purpose of any recording that may have taken place on February 27, 2025.

Dean is researching the weight limit his Honda Civic can carry. He  will
remove as many bags as he can tonight from the property.

He will be at 518 Stoneman at 5:30pm, as discussed.

We are not able to remove the sandbags entirely this week.

Dean can move the sandbags from obstructing your front door  today. He can
also move the sandbags on the patio into a corner so as not to obstruct
your use of the patio.

*Dean will come to 518 at 5:30pm today unless you indicate otherwise by
5:00pm*.
He will need access to the patio area.  Kindly advise if you no longer wish
to have the sandbags moved.

I still affirm that I will communicate the next steps for water
remediation and that we continue to  actively work on fixing all water
intrusion issues reported at the property.


Respectfully,

Gail Houser

Dean can come on 2/17 between 5:30-6:30pm to remove the sandbags all together. The sandbags have been here for a year now and we would like them to be removed completely. I mentioned this to you and Dean on 1/7/25. If you wish to store them in the closet space you have here in the garage, you can do so. 

Do you know when a plumber will come and fix the pipes in the garage that have been leaking for weeks now? Is one scheduled to come anytime soon?

I acknowledge the receipt of your email on 2/14/25. I will notify you of
next steps when I have that information available.

Would you like us to reposition  the sandbags so they are not in your way
when rain is not in the forecast?

Dean is available  to move sandbags on:

1. 2/17/25 between 5:30 and 6:30pm or
2. 2/18/25 between 5:30 and 6:30pm .

If you prefer to keep the sandbags  in place, that is fine with us as well.

I am going to continue to document and report all instances of water intrusion in the unit as they occur. I will notify you via email with as many videos and photos, as I have been doing for months.

I understand that you would like to see the water in person, but given that water intrusion does not occur on a set schedule, and I have other obligations such as work and family responsibilities, it is not practical or reasonable for me to call you at any hour of the day or night to allow for an in-person visit. Seeing the water firsthand does not change the fact that the issue needs permanent repairs, not just continued assessment. 

However, I am more than willing to coordinate access to the unit for licensed professionals who can actually assess and address the issues, as well as begin actual repairs. 

I would like to continue to point out that the garage is STILL leaking from the ceiling and those pipes that you‚Äôve seen first hand have been leaking. I have not heard any updates from you on when those pipes will be addressed. I reported this to you directly on 12/29/24. I‚Äôm not sure what the delay may be now but I‚Äôm requesting for a response and for it to be fixed immediately.

You have two options for filing that. You can file a separate case for retaliation by going to this website and following the instructions Complaint Process | CRD<https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/complaintprocess/>, or you can provide me the details and I can investigate it alongside the current investigation. If you would like for me to investigate, please schedule a phone call with me to discuss the situation OR provide a detailed description of what happened, why you believe it is in retaliation, what you believe it is in retaliation of, etc.  I will also need any evidence you have such as the 60-day notice to vacate and any other evidence you feel is pertinent.

Good morning,



I have placed the summary of the respondent‚Äôs defense below. Please review and respond to this email with any response you may have. This can include details you feel are incorrect, missing or anything you would like to add. I would also like you to send me any evidence you have regarding the case, so emails, text messages, documents, etc. Anything that you feel relates to the case, please go ahead and send that to me. If you have any witnesses, please provide me with their contact information and what information you believe they can provide. Finally, I will be sending you a medical release form to be completed today so that I can contact your doctor. Please review and complete as soon as possible.



Respondent Defense summary:

Respondents denied all allegations. Respondents stated that on or around May 22nd they went for scheduled site visit to address some repairs. Respondents stated that on that visit they discovered that the glass shower enclosure from the upstairs bathroom had been removed without permission causing damage to the downstairs ceiling. Respondents stated that at that time they requested that you make no further changes to the property without prior approval of the owners. Respondents stated that you responded to this by telling them that you were just ‚Äúwaiting until the end of the lease to move out‚Äù and that you ‚Äúwould not be friendly going forward.‚Äù Respondents stated that on May 30th they went to repair a leaky toilet on the property where it was discovered that a bidet was installed without approval. Respondents stated that they decided at this time not to renew the lease and began to work on the 90-day notice. Respondents stated that they arranged a contractor to come and work on repairs at the property beginning June 17th and received confirmation from you that that would be fine. Respondents stated that when they and the contractor showed up to begin the work, they discovered a large dog on the property that they did not have any previous knowledge of. Respondents stated that they contacted you to ask about the dog and rearrange the start of the repairs as the dog could not be on the property. Respondents stated that you responded to them that the dog was your emotional support animal, but you did not submit any request for this animal previously or during this exchange. Respondents stated that on June 19th, they emailed you a letter of non-renewal of the lease, a lease violation for an animal on premises without seeking accommodation and unapproved repairs, alterations, or improvements as well as a 90-day notice which was not acknowledged by you at all. Respondents stated that they then mailed then to you which was delivered on July 15th. Respondents stated on August 5th they received a formal request for an emotional support animal in which they responded to let you know that they were not extending the lease, but you could provide a medical letter if you wished to formalize the process. Respondents stated that a letter was submitted by you from your healthcare professional on August 12th. Respondents stated that they asked you sign an animal terms and conditions addendum which was returned by you on August 21st. Respondents stated that they sent a confirmation of lease termination and non-renewal of the lease, and an offer was provided if you needed more time to make plans. Respondents stated that you entered a month-to-month contract as of August 30th.

Hello Lauren,



Thank you for letting me know. An email with all the necessary information would be just as good. Please go ahead and email us with the response from the respondents in further detail, if any, along with the next steps of the beginning of the investigation and what you may need from me and how to provide that to you or to whoever would be conducting the investigation.



If I have any questions I will reach out to schedule a phone call, however for now I think e-mail works best.



Thank you! I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Good morning Lauren,





I‚Äôm following up on the missed call you had set up for us for 12/9 at 11am. I called to leave a voicemail and followed up with an email as well and haven‚Äôt heard back. Please let me know if you are still going to call to speak with me regarding the case and the response you received from the respondents.



My cell phone number is 323-336-7829.



An email response would suffice as well. I want to ensure I know what the status of the case is and what to expect next.

I have received a response from the respondents, and they have declined this offer and declined to participate in conciliation any further. At this point, I will need to move forward with this investigation. I would like to set up a short phone call with you to discuss this case and the response that we received from the respondents.

Good Morning,





I have additional concerns regarding my case. At this time and for quite some time, the unit we are renting has had maintenance issues that have either been ignored, brushed off as nothing or have been delayed drastically. At the moment, the respondent has hired a property management company to handle all aspects of the unit. We have reported numerous repairs such as water intrusion into the unit, signs of mildew and mold, and plumbing issues. The manager has stated that no repairs can be made unless they have approval of the respondent. We have slow active leaks in our garage which is over time damaging our items and not allowing us to use the space we pay for, a toilet that leaks, a patio that requires weather proofing, etc. We have reported these issues to the respondent before and now since having the new management company. None of those issues have been fixed. We have had 2 different plumbers take a look at the issues we reported and have each stated that pipes were improperly ""fixed"" and would need to be replaced, among other things they noticed. From September 5th up until now that we have brought all these issues to light, nothing has been done. There is no urgency or concern for these issues, if anything, the manager is very dismissive and has a bad attitude about the issues we bring up to her. I have already filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Health Department and the manager and respondent were aware of the complaint, yet nothing happened.



I strongly feel that the lack of urgency and the negligence is due to retaliation for asserting my rights and filing this exact complaint. I strongly believe this because the manager herself has said that nothing can be fixed without the approval of the respondents.



I cannot simply gather terms when I feel I am being retaliated against and am still living with overwhelming stress and anxiety because the unit I pay so much for, is not being taken care.



Are you able to assist with this matter since it feels like retaliation from this complaint?

Good morning,



It can begin at any time. As soon as I get a settlement offer from you, I will present that to the respondents. They will have the option to accept, decline or present a counteroffer. I will present you with the respondent‚Äôs response and then we will continue that process until a settlement is determined and an agreement can be signed. If someone declines to continue the process, I will just continue investigating the case. Please be aware that I am a neutral party in this, and I am just the middle man presenting the offers and creating the conciliation agreement for everyone to sign if you come to terms you agree with.

Good afternoon,



We do not have a list of possible remedies or compensation options. The only thing I can really tell you is that most cases for our department settlement for somewhere between $2000-$5000 and we like all conciliation to include fair housing training or posting of a fair housing poster.  Outside of that, it is up to you. I would recommend thinking about what would make you feel better about this matter.

Good Afternoon,

I am open to conciliation, however, I have not yet finalized my terms. If the respondents have a settlement offer in mind, I would be open to reviewing and discussing it.

Additionally, could you provide any guidance or a list of possible remedies or compensation options that are typically considered in cases with similar allegations? This would help me better understand the potential resolution options as I continue to finalize my terms.

Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognize the sender and know the content is safe. &nbsp; Good Morning, &nbsp; &nbsp; I have additional concerns regarding my case. At this time and for quite some time, the unit we are renting has had maintenance issues that have either been ignored, brushed off as nothing or have been delayed drastically. At the moment, the respondent has hired a property management company to handle all aspects of the unit. We have reported numerous repairs such as water intrusion into the unit, signs of mildew and mold, and plumbing issues. The manager has stated that no repairs can be made unless they have approval of the respondent. We have slow active leaks in our garage which is over time damaging our items and not allowing us to use the space we pay for, a toilet that leaks, a patio that requires weather proofing, etc. We have reported these issues to the respondent before and now since having the new management company. None of those issues have been fixed. We have had 2 different plumbers take a look at the issues we reported and have each stated that pipes were improperly ""fixed"" and would need to be replaced, among other things they noticed. From September 5th up until now that we have brought all these issues to light, nothing has been done. There is no urgency or concern for these issues, if anything, the manager is very dismissive and has a bad attitude about the issues we bring up to her. I have already filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Health Department and the manager and respondent were aware of the complaint, yet nothing happened. &nbsp; I strongly feel that the lack of urgency and the negligence is due to retaliation for asserting my rights and filing this exact complaint. I strongly believe this because the manager herself has said that nothing can be fixed without the approval of the respondents.&nbsp; &nbsp; I cannot simply gather terms when I feel I am being retaliated against and am still living with overwhelming stress and anxiety because the unit I pay so much for, is not being taken care.&nbsp; &nbsp; Are you able to assist with this matter since it feels like retaliation from this complaint? &nbsp; On Thursday, October 10, 2024 at 08:55:32 AM PDT, Witham, Lauren@CalCivilRights &lt; lauren.witham@calcivilrights.ca.gov &gt; wrote: &nbsp; &nbsp; Good morning, &nbsp; It can begin at any time.

I will present you with the respondent‚Äôs response and then we will continue that process until a settlement is determined and an agreement can be signed. If someone declines to continue the process, I will just continue investigating the case. Please be aware that I am a neutral party in this, and I am just the middle man presenting the offers and creating the conciliation agreement for everyone to sign if you come to terms you agree with. &nbsp; Thank you, &nbsp; Lauren Witham Associate Governmental Program Analyst| Housing Unit California Civil Rights Department Phone: 916.964-1988 Email: Lauren.Witham@Calcivilrights.ca.gov &nbsp; &nbsp; CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: This communication with its contents may contain confidential and/or legally privileged information.

There is water underneath the floorboards in the entry way and restroom tiles. This is exactly what happened last year when it rained. This is also what has happened a few other times within the last year when it also rained. The garage continues to leak when it rains from the ceiling and the pipes I‚Äôve previously reported since September 20, 2024 (20 weeks ago!) are still leaking and causing further damage to our personal belongings.&nbsp; I cannot stress how this violates Civil Code 1941.1. I am requesting immediate repairs to the root issue of the water intrusion in the unit and the plumbing in the garage. Making temporary and minor repairs to redirect the water flow is insufficient as it is not the root cause of the water intrusion.&nbsp; Please respond with your plan of action and again a timeline of repairs that are scheduled to fix the root issue of the water intrusion.

Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognize the sender and know the content is safe. &nbsp; Good Morning, &nbsp; &nbsp; I have additional concerns regarding my case. At this time and for quite some time, the unit we are renting has had maintenance issues that have either been ignored, brushed off as nothing or have been delayed drastically. At the moment, the respondent has hired a property management company to handle all aspects of the unit. We have reported numerous repairs such as water intrusion into the unit, signs of mildew and mold, and plumbing issues. The manager has stated that no repairs can be made unless they have approval of the respondent. We have slow active leaks in our garage which is over time damaging our items and not allowing us to use the space we pay for, a toilet that leaks, a patio that requires weather proofing, etc. We have reported these issues to the respondent before and now since having the new management company. None of those issues have been fixed. We have had 2 different plumbers take a look at the issues we reported and have each stated that pipes were improperly ""fixed"" and would need to be replaced, among other things they noticed. From September 5th up until now that we have brought all these issues to light, nothing has been done. There is no urgency or concern for these issues, if anything, the manager is very dismissive and has a bad attitude about the issues we bring up to her. I have already filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Health Department and the manager and respondent were aware of the complaint, yet nothing happened. &nbsp; I strongly feel that the lack of urgency and the negligence is due to retaliation for asserting my rights and filing this exact complaint. I strongly believe this because the manager herself has said that nothing can be fixed without the approval of the respondents.&nbsp; &nbsp; I cannot simply gather terms when I feel I am being retaliated against and am still living with overwhelming stress and anxiety because the unit I pay so much for, is not being taken care.&nbsp; &nbsp; Are you able to assist with this matter since it feels like retaliation from this complaint? &nbsp; On Thursday, October 10, 2024 at 08:55:32 AM PDT, Witham, Lauren@CalCivilRights &lt; lauren.witham@calcivilrights.ca.gov &gt; wrote: &nbsp; &nbsp; Good morning, &nbsp; It can begin at any time.

Good morning,



I have placed the summary of the respondent‚Äôs defense below. Please review and respond to this email with any response you may have. This can include details you feel are incorrect, missing or anything you would like to add. I would also like you to send me any evidence you have regarding the case, so emails, text messages, documents, etc. Anything that you feel relates to the case, please go ahead and send that to me. If you have any witnesses, please provide me with their contact information and what information you believe they can provide. Finally, I will be sending you a medical release form to be completed today so that I can contact your doctor. Please review and complete as soon as possible.



Respondent Defense summary:

Respondents denied all allegations. Respondents stated that on or around May 22nd they went for scheduled site visit to address some repairs. Respondents stated that on that visit they discovered that the glass shower enclosure from the upstairs bathroom had been removed without permission causing damage to the downstairs ceiling. Respondents stated that at that time they requested that you make no further changes to the property without prior approval of the owners. Respondents stated that you responded to this by telling them that you were just ‚Äúwaiting until the end of the lease to move out‚Äù and that you ‚Äúwould not be friendly going forward.‚Äù Respondents stated that on May 30th they went to repair a leaky toilet on the property where it was discovered that a bidet was installed without approval. Respondents stated that they decided at this time not to renew the lease and began to work on the 90-day notice. Respondents stated that they arranged a contractor to come and work on repairs at the property beginning June 17th and received confirmation from you that that would be fine. Respondents stated that when they and the contractor showed up to begin the work, they discovered a large dog on the property that they did not have any previous knowledge of. Respondents stated that they contacted you to ask about the dog and rearrange the start of the repairs as the dog could not be on the property. Respondents stated that you responded to them that the dog was your emotional support animal, but you did not submit any request for this animal previously or during this exchange. Respondents stated that on June 19th, they emailed you a letter of non-renewal of the lease, a lease violation for an animal on premises without seeking accommodation and unapproved repairs, alterations, or improvements as well as a 90-day notice which was not acknowledged by you at all. Respondents stated that they then mailed then to you which was delivered on July 15th. Respondents stated on August 5th they received a formal request for an emotional support animal in which they responded to let you know that they were not extending the lease, but you could provide a medical letter if you wished to formalize the process. Respondents stated that a letter was submitted by you from your healthcare professional on August 12th. Respondents stated that they asked you sign an animal terms and conditions addendum which was returned by you on August 21st. Respondents stated that they sent a confirmation of lease termination and non-renewal of the lease, and an offer was provided if you needed more time to make plans. Respondents stated that you entered a month-to-month contract as of August 30th.

Hello Lauren,



Thank you for letting me know. An email with all the necessary information would be just as good. Please go ahead and email us with the response from the respondents in further detail, if any, along with the next steps of the beginning of the investigation and what you may need from me and how to provide that to you or to whoever would be conducting the investigation.

Good Morning,





I have additional concerns regarding my case. At this time and for quite some time, the unit we are renting has had maintenance issues that have either been ignored, brushed off as nothing or have been delayed drastically. At the moment, the respondent has hired a property management company to handle all aspects of the unit. We have reported numerous repairs such as water intrusion into the unit, signs of mildew and mold, and plumbing issues. The manager has stated that no repairs can be made unless they have approval of the respondent. We have slow active leaks in our garage which is over time damaging our items and not allowing us to use the space we pay for, a toilet that leaks, a patio that requires weather proofing, etc. We have reported these issues to the respondent before and now since having the new management company. None of those issues have been fixed. We have had 2 different plumbers take a look at the issues we reported and have each stated that pipes were improperly ""fixed"" and would need to be replaced, among other things they noticed. From September 5th up until now that we have brought all these issues to light, nothing has been done. There is no urgency or concern for these issues, if anything, the manager is very dismissive and has a bad attitude about the issues we bring up to her. I have already filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Health Department and the manager and respondent were aware of the complaint, yet nothing happened.



I strongly feel that the lack of urgency and the negligence is due to retaliation for asserting my rights and filing this exact complaint. I strongly believe this because the manager herself has said that nothing can be fixed without the approval of the respondents.



I cannot simply gather terms when I feel I am being retaliated against and am still living with overwhelming stress and anxiety because the unit I pay so much for, is not being taken care.



Are you able to assist with this matter since it feels like retaliation from this complaint?

Good morning,



It can begin at any time. As soon as I get a settlement offer from you, I will present that to the respondents. They will have the option to accept, decline or present a counteroffer. I will present you with the respondent‚Äôs response and then we will continue that process until a settlement is determined and an agreement can be signed. If someone declines to continue the process, I will just continue investigating the case. Please be aware that I am a neutral party in this, and I am just the middle man presenting the offers and creating the conciliation agreement for everyone to sign if you come to terms you agree with.

Good afternoon,



We do not have a list of possible remedies or compensation options. The only thing I can really tell you is that most cases for our department settlement for somewhere between $2000-$5000 and we like all conciliation to include fair housing training or posting of a fair housing poster.  Outside of that, it is up to you. I would recommend thinking about what would make you feel better about this matter.

I am open to conciliation, however, I have not yet finalized my terms. If the respondents have a settlement offer in mind, I would be open to reviewing and discussing it.

Additionally, could you provide any guidance or a list of possible remedies or compensation options that are typically considered in cases with similar allegations? This would help me better understand the potential resolution options as I continue to finalize my terms.

Can you confirm interior access on Feb 5?

We do not anticipate a need to access the interior for gutter work. Please
be advised that work will take place outside.

We are waiting for an appointment confirmation from ServePro to evaluate
moisture in the interior of the home.

Can ServePro access the interior of the unit on February 4 if a technician

I want to clarify that our requests for repairs are not recent, as you stated. We initially reported water intrusion in the entryway/living room nearly one year ago on February 4, 2024. The patio has been an ongoing concern, and the garage pipes were reported on September 20, 2024. We have repeatedly provided videos and pictures to show the damage. We have also had technicians, contractors and plumbers come to make assessments, yet no repairs have been scheduled, no timeline has been given, and no resolution has been provided.

Water intrusion and lack of proper weatherproofing are habitability violations under California state law. With worsening weather conditions and increasing damage, I am formally requesting an immediate and comprehensive mold inspection at your expense.

Please provide a clear timeline for these necessary and long overdue repairs, not just a list of companies you have contacted.

Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognize the sender and know the content is safe. &nbsp; Good Morning, &nbsp; &nbsp; I have additional concerns regarding my case. At this time and for quite some time, the unit we are renting has had maintenance issues that have either been ignored, brushed off as nothing or have been delayed drastically. At the moment, the respondent has hired a property management company to handle all aspects of the unit. We have reported numerous repairs such as water intrusion into the unit, signs of mildew and mold, and plumbing issues. The manager has stated that no repairs can be made unless they have approval of the respondent. We have slow active leaks in our garage which is over time damaging our items and not allowing us to use the space we pay for, a toilet that leaks, a patio that requires weather proofing, etc. We have reported these issues to the respondent before and now since having the new management company. None of those issues have been fixed. We have had 2 different plumbers take a look at the issues we reported and have each stated that pipes were improperly ""fixed"" and would need to be replaced, among other things they noticed. From September 5th up until now that we have brought all these issues to light, nothing has been done. There is no urgency or concern for these issues, if anything, the manager is very dismissive and has a bad attitude about the issues we bring up to her. I have already filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Health Department and the manager and respondent were aware of the complaint, yet nothing happened. &nbsp; I strongly feel that the lack of urgency and the negligence is due to retaliation for asserting my rights and filing this exact complaint. I strongly believe this because the manager herself has said that nothing can be fixed without the approval of the respondents.&nbsp; &nbsp; I cannot simply gather terms when I feel I am being retaliated against and am still living with overwhelming stress and anxiety because the unit I pay so much for, is not being taken care.&nbsp; &nbsp; Are you able to assist with this matter since it feels like retaliation from this complaint? &nbsp; On Thursday, October 10, 2024 at 08:55:32 AM PDT, Witham, Lauren@CalCivilRights &lt; lauren.witham@calcivilrights.ca.gov &gt; wrote: &nbsp; &nbsp; Good morning, &nbsp; It can begin at any time.

If someone declines to continue the process, I will just continue investigating the case. Please be aware that I am a neutral party in this, and I am just the middle man presenting the offers and creating the conciliation agreement for everyone to sign if you come to terms you agree with. &nbsp; Thank you, &nbsp; Lauren Witham Associate Governmental Program Analyst| Housing Unit California Civil Rights Department Phone: 916.964-1988 Email: Lauren.Witham@Calcivilrights.ca.gov &nbsp; &nbsp; CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: This communication with its contents may contain confidential and/or legally privileged information.

Thank you for the videos and photos.
I have requested remediation of the current water intrusion you are
reporting.
Servpro will be out to evaluate the situation on Thursday or Friday this
week.
I will forward an appointment window to you as it is known to me.

I‚Äôm checking in to see if there is any update?

As you may have known, it rained over the weekend and our garage was leaking again and smelling absolutely foul, the way it smells when there is too much moisture sitting around, or mold. Which raises concerns again about mold in the unit, if it is not properly weather proofed.

We‚Äôve mentioned it many times to multiple people throughout our tenancy. We have waited and are still waiting for necessary changes to be made to finally address and fix this year long issue. 

We also noticed some water again in our front entry area. An area that was affected and damaged last year in February due to rain. Again, raises significant concerns regarding mold if water enters the unit and sits there.

Good morning,



I have placed the summary of the respondent‚Äôs defense below. Please review and respond to this email with any response you may have. This can include details you feel are incorrect, missing or anything you would like to add. I would also like you to send me any evidence you have regarding the case, so emails, text messages, documents, etc. Anything that you feel relates to the case, please go ahead and send that to me. If you have any witnesses, please provide me with their contact information and what information you believe they can provide. Finally, I will be sending you a medical release form to be completed today so that I can contact your doctor. Please review and complete as soon as possible.



Respondent Defense summary:

Respondents denied all allegations. Respondents stated that on or around May 22nd they went for scheduled site visit to address some repairs. Respondents stated that on that visit they discovered that the glass shower enclosure from the upstairs bathroom had been removed without permission causing damage to the downstairs ceiling. Respondents stated that at that time they requested that you make no further changes to the property without prior approval of the owners. Respondents stated that you responded to this by telling them that you were just ‚Äúwaiting until the end of the lease to move out‚Äù and that you ‚Äúwould not be friendly going forward.‚Äù Respondents stated that on May 30th they went to repair a leaky toilet on the property where it was discovered that a bidet was installed without approval. Respondents stated that they decided at this time not to renew the lease and began to work on the 90-day notice. Respondents stated that they arranged a contractor to come and work on repairs at the property beginning June 17th and received confirmation from you that that would be fine. Respondents stated that when they and the contractor showed up to begin the work, they discovered a large dog on the property that they did not have any previous knowledge of. Respondents stated that they contacted you to ask about the dog and rearrange the start of the repairs as the dog could not be on the property. Respondents stated that you responded to them that the dog was your emotional support animal, but you did not submit any request for this animal previously or during this exchange. Respondents stated that on June 19th, they emailed you a letter of non-renewal of the lease, a lease violation for an animal on premises without seeking accommodation and unapproved repairs, alterations, or improvements as well as a 90-day notice which was not acknowledged by you at all. Respondents stated that they then mailed then to you which was delivered on July 15th. Respondents stated on August 5th they received a formal request for an emotional support animal in which they responded to let you know that they were not extending the lease, but you could provide a medical letter if you wished to formalize the process. Respondents stated that a letter was submitted by you from your healthcare professional on August 12th. Respondents stated that they asked you sign an animal terms and conditions addendum which was returned by you on August 21st. Respondents stated that they sent a confirmation of lease termination and non-renewal of the lease, and an offer was provided if you needed more time to make plans. Respondents stated that you entered a month-to-month contract as of August 30th.

Hello Lauren,



Thank you for letting me know. An email with all the necessary information would be just as good. Please go ahead and email us with the response from the respondents in further detail, if any, along with the next steps of the beginning of the investigation and what you may need from me and how to provide that to you or to whoever would be conducting the investigation.

Good Morning,





I have additional concerns regarding my case. At this time and for quite some time, the unit we are renting has had maintenance issues that have either been ignored, brushed off as nothing or have been delayed drastically. At the moment, the respondent has hired a property management company to handle all aspects of the unit. We have reported numerous repairs such as water intrusion into the unit, signs of mildew and mold, and plumbing issues. The manager has stated that no repairs can be made unless they have approval of the respondent. We have slow active leaks in our garage which is over time damaging our items and not allowing us to use the space we pay for, a toilet that leaks, a patio that requires weather proofing, etc. We have reported these issues to the respondent before and now since having the new management company. None of those issues have been fixed. We have had 2 different plumbers take a look at the issues we reported and have each stated that pipes were improperly ""fixed"" and would need to be replaced, among other things they noticed. From September 5th up until now that we have brought all these issues to light, nothing has been done. There is no urgency or concern for these issues, if anything, the manager is very dismissive and has a bad attitude about the issues we bring up to her. I have already filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Health Department and the manager and respondent were aware of the complaint, yet nothing happened.



I strongly feel that the lack of urgency and the negligence is due to retaliation for asserting my rights and filing this exact complaint. I strongly believe this because the manager herself has said that nothing can be fixed without the approval of the respondents.



I cannot simply gather terms when I feel I am being retaliated against and am still living with overwhelming stress and anxiety because the unit I pay so much for, is not being taken care.



Are you able to assist with this matter since it feels like retaliation from this complaint?

Good morning,



It can begin at any time. As soon as I get a settlement offer from you, I will present that to the respondents. They will have the option to accept, decline or present a counteroffer. I will present you with the respondent‚Äôs response and then we will continue that process until a settlement is determined and an agreement can be signed. If someone declines to continue the process, I will just continue investigating the case. Please be aware that I am a neutral party in this, and I am just the middle man presenting the offers and creating the conciliation agreement for everyone to sign if you come to terms you agree with.

Good afternoon,



We do not have a list of possible remedies or compensation options. The only thing I can really tell you is that most cases for our department settlement for somewhere between $2000-$5000 and we like all conciliation to include fair housing training or posting of a fair housing poster.  Outside of that, it is up to you. I would recommend thinking about what would make you feel better about this matter.

Good Afternoon,

I am open to conciliation, however, I have not yet finalized my terms. If the respondents have a settlement offer in mind, I would be open to reviewing and discussing it.

Additionally, could you provide any guidance or a list of possible remedies or compensation options that are typically considered in cases with similar allegations? This would help me better understand the potential resolution options as I continue to finalize my terms.

Thank you again for your assistance.

As part of the normal case processing, we offer mediation and conciliation for all of our cases.

Can you please let me know if you are interested in the conciliating the case and what your terms would be. If you have questions, please let me know.

Good morning, 
 
¬†
 
I have placed the summary of the respondent‚Äôs defense below. Please review and respond to this email with any response you may have. This can include details you feel are incorrect, missing or anything you would like to add. I would also like you to send me any evidence you have regarding the case, so emails, text messages, documents, etc. Anything that you feel relates to the case, please go ahead and send that to me. If you have any witnesses, please provide me with their contact information and what information you believe they can provide. Finally, I will be sending you a medical release form to be completed today so that I can contact your doctor. Please review and complete as soon as possible.

Respondent Defense summary:¬†¬†¬†¬† 
 
Respondents denied all allegations. Respondents stated that on or around May 22nd they went for scheduled site visit to address some repairs. Respondents stated that on that visit they discovered that the glass shower enclosure from the upstairs bathroom had been removed without permission causing damage to the downstairs ceiling. Respondents stated that at that time they requested that you make no further changes to the property without prior approval of the owners. Respondents stated that you responded to this by telling them that you were just ‚Äúwaiting until the end of the lease to move out‚Äù and that you ‚Äúwould not be friendly going forward.‚Äù Respondents stated that on May 30th they went to repair a leaky toilet on the property where it was discovered that a bidet was installed without approval. Respondents stated that they decided at this time not to renew the lease and began to work on the 90-day notice. Respondents stated that they arranged a contractor to come and work on repairs at the property beginning June 17th and received confirmation from you that that would be fine. Respondents stated that when they and the contractor showed up to begin the work, they discovered a large dog on the property that they did not have any previous knowledge of. Respondents stated that they contacted you to ask about the dog and rearrange the start of the repairs as the dog could not be on the property. Respondents stated that you responded to them that the dog was your emotional support animal, but you did not submit any request for this animal previously or during this exchange. Respondents stated that on June 19th, they emailed you a letter of non-renewal of the lease, a lease violation for an animal on premises without seeking accommodation and unapproved repairs, alterations, or improvements as well as a 90-day notice which was not acknowledged by you at all. Respondents stated that they then mailed then to you which was delivered on July 15th. Respondents stated on August 5th they received a formal request for an emotional support animal in which they responded to let you know that they were not extending the lease, but you could provide a medical letter if you wished to formalize the process. Respondents stated that a letter was submitted by you from your healthcare professional on August 12th. Respondents stated that they asked you sign an animal terms and conditions addendum which was returned by you on August 21st. Respondents stated that they sent a confirmation of lease termination and non-renewal of the lease, and an offer was provided if you needed more time to make plans. Respondents stated that you entered a month-to-month contract as of August 30th.¬†

Good Morning,
 
¬†

I have additional concerns regarding my case. At this time and for quite some time, the unit we are renting has had maintenance issues that have either been ignored, brushed off as nothing or have been delayed drastically. At the moment, the respondent has hired a property management company to handle all aspects of the unit. We have reported numerous repairs such as water intrusion into the unit, signs of mildew and mold, and plumbing issues. The manager has stated that no repairs can be made unless they have approval of the respondent. We have slow active leaks in our garage which is over time damaging our items and not allowing us to use the space we pay for, a toilet that leaks, a patio that requires weather proofing, etc. We have reported these issues to the respondent before and now since having the new management company. None of those issues have been fixed. We have had 2 different plumbers take a look at the issues we reported and have each stated that pipes were improperly ""fixed"" and would need to be replaced, among other things they noticed. From September 5th up until now that we have brought all these issues to light, nothing has been done. There is no urgency or concern for these issues, if anything, the manager is very dismissive and has a bad attitude about the issues we bring up to her. I have already filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Health Department and the manager and respondent were aware of the complaint, yet nothing happened.

I strongly feel that the lack of urgency and the negligence is due to retaliation for asserting my rights and filing this exact complaint. I strongly believe this because the manager herself has said that nothing can be fixed without the approval of the respondents.¬†

I cannot simply gather terms when I feel I am being retaliated against and am still living with overwhelming stress and anxiety because the unit I pay so much for, is not being taken care.¬†

Are you able to assist with this matter since it feels like retaliation from this complaint?

It can begin at any time. As soon as I get a settlement offer from you, I will present that to the respondents. They will have the option to accept, decline or present a counteroffer. I will present you with the respondent‚Äôs response and then we will continue that process until a settlement is determined and an agreement can be signed. If someone declines to continue the process, I will just continue investigating the case. Please be aware that I am a neutral party in this, and I am just the middle man presenting the offers and creating the conciliation agreement for everyone to sign if you come to terms you agree with.

Good afternoon,

We do not have a list of possible remedies or compensation options. The only thing I can really tell you is that most cases for our department settlement for somewhere between $2000-$5000 and we like all conciliation to include fair housing training or posting of a fair housing poster.¬† Outside of that, it is up to you. I would recommend thinking about what would make you feel better about this matter.

Good Afternoon,
 
I am open to conciliation, however, I have not yet finalized my terms. If the respondents have a settlement offer in mind, I would be open to reviewing and discussing it.
 
Additionally, could you provide any guidance or a list of possible remedies or compensation options that are typically considered in cases with similar allegations? This would help me better understand the potential resolution options as I continue to finalize my terms.
 
Thank you again for your assistance.

Good afternoon,

As part of the normal case processing, we offer mediation and conciliation for all of our cases. I have spoken with the respondents in this matter, and they are interested in potentially conciliating the case. They would like to know what your settlement terms would be for the case. Can you please let me know if you are interested in the conciliating the case and what your terms would be. If you have questions, please let me know.

Good morning, 
 
¬†
 
I have placed the summary of the respondent‚Äôs defense below. Please review and respond to this email with any response you may have. This can include details you feel are incorrect, missing or anything you would like to add. I would also like you to send me any evidence you have regarding the case, so emails, text messages, documents, etc. Anything that you feel relates to the case, please go ahead and send that to me. If you have any witnesses, please provide me with their contact information and what information you believe they can provide.

Respondent Defense summary:¬†¬†¬†¬† 
 
Respondents denied all allegations. Respondents stated that on or around May 22nd they went for scheduled site visit to address some repairs. Respondents stated that on that visit they discovered that the glass shower enclosure from the upstairs bathroom had been removed without permission causing damage to the downstairs ceiling. Respondents stated that at that time they requested that you make no further changes to the property without prior approval of the owners. Respondents stated that you responded to this by telling them that you were just ‚Äúwaiting until the end of the lease to move out‚Äù and that you ‚Äúwould not be friendly going forward.‚Äù Respondents stated that on May 30th they went to repair a leaky toilet on the property where it was discovered that a bidet was installed without approval. Respondents stated that they decided at this time not to renew the lease and began to work on the 90-day notice. Respondents stated that they arranged a contractor to come and work on repairs at the property beginning June 17th and received confirmation from you that that would be fine. Respondents stated that when they and the contractor showed up to begin the work, they discovered a large dog on the property that they did not have any previous knowledge of. Respondents stated that they contacted you to ask about the dog and rearrange the start of the repairs as the dog could not be on the property. Respondents stated that you responded to them that the dog was your emotional support animal, but you did not submit any request for this animal previously or during this exchange. Respondents stated that on June 19th, they emailed you a letter of non-renewal of the lease, a lease violation for an animal on premises without seeking accommodation and unapproved repairs, alterations, or improvements as well as a 90-day notice which was not acknowledged by you at all. Respondents stated that they then mailed then to you which was delivered on July 15th. Respondents stated on August 5th they received a formal request for an emotional support animal in which they responded to let you know that they were not extending the lease, but you could provide a medical letter if you wished to formalize the process. Respondents stated that a letter was submitted by you from your healthcare professional on August 12th. Respondents stated that they asked you sign an animal terms and conditions addendum which was returned by you on August 21st. Respondents stated that they sent a confirmation of lease termination and non-renewal of the lease, and an offer was provided if you needed more time to make plans. Respondents stated that you entered a month-to-month contract as of August 30th.¬†

Thank you for letting me know. An email with all the necessary information would be just as good.

Good Morning,
 
¬†
 
¬†
 
I have additional concerns regarding my case. At this time and for quite some time, the unit we are renting has had maintenance issues that have either been ignored, brushed off as nothing or have been delayed drastically. At the moment, the respondent has hired a property management company to handle all aspects of the unit. We have reported numerous repairs such as water intrusion into the unit, signs of mildew and mold, and plumbing issues. The manager has stated that no repairs can be made unless they have approval of the respondent. We have slow active leaks in our garage which is over time damaging our items and not allowing us to use the space we pay for, a toilet that leaks, a patio that requires weather proofing, etc. We have reported these issues to the respondent before and now since having the new management company. None of those issues have been fixed. We have had 2 different plumbers take a look at the issues we reported and have each stated that pipes were improperly ""fixed"" and would need to be replaced, among other things they noticed. From September 5th up until now that we have brought all these issues to light, nothing has been done. There is no urgency or concern for these issues, if anything, the manager is very dismissive and has a bad attitude about the issues we bring up to her. I have already filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Health Department and the manager and respondent were aware of the complaint, yet nothing happened.
 
¬†
 
I strongly feel that the lack of urgency and the negligence is due to retaliation for asserting my rights and filing this exact complaint. I strongly believe this because the manager herself has said that nothing can be fixed without the approval of the respondents.¬†
 
¬†
 
I cannot simply gather terms when I feel I am being retaliated against and am still living with overwhelming stress and anxiety because the unit I pay so much for, is not being taken care.¬†
 
¬†
 
Are you able to assist with this matter since it feels like retaliation from this complaint?

Good Afternoon,
 
I am open to conciliation, however, I have not yet finalized my terms. If the respondents have a settlement offer in mind, I would be open to reviewing and discussing it.
 
Additionally, could you provide any guidance or a list of possible remedies or compensation options that are typically considered in cases with similar allegations? This would help me better understand the potential resolution options as I continue to finalize my terms.
 
Thank you again for your assistance.

At this time and for quite some time, the unit we are renting has had maintenance issues that have either been ignored, brushed off as nothing or have been delayed drastically.

We have reported numerous repairs such as water intrusion into the unit, signs of mildew and mold, and plumbing issues. The manager has stated that no repairs can be made unless they have approval of the respondent. We have slow active leaks in our garage which is over time damaging our items and not allowing us to use the space we pay for, a toilet that leaks, a patio that requires weather proofing, etc. We have reported these issues to the respondent before and now since having the new management company. None of those issues have been fixed. We have had 2 different plumbers take a look at the issues we reported and have each stated that pipes were improperly ""fixed"" and would need to be replaced, among other things they noticed. From September 5th up until now that we have brought all these issues to light, nothing has been done. There is no urgency or concern for these issues, if anything, the manager is very dismissive and has a bad attitude about the issues we bring up to her. I have already filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Health Department and the manager and respondent were aware of the complaint, yet nothing happened. &nbsp; I strongly feel that the lack of urgency and the negligence is due to retaliation for asserting my rights and filing this exact complaint. I strongly believe this because the manager herself has said that nothing can be fixed without the approval of the respondents.&nbsp; &nbsp; I cannot simply gather terms when I feel I am being retaliated against and am still living with overwhelming stress and anxiety because the unit I pay so much for, is not being taken care.&nbsp; &nbsp; Are you able to assist with this matter since it feels like retaliation from this complaint? &nbsp; On Thursday, October 10, 2024 at 08:55:32 AM PDT, Witham, Lauren@CalCivilRights &lt; lauren.witham@calcivilrights.ca.gov &gt; wrote: &nbsp; &nbsp; Good morning, &nbsp; It can begin at any time.
